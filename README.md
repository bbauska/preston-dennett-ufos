<p>A face-to-face encounter with a humanoid creature is one of the most shocking and 
mindboggling experiences a person can have. And it happens more often than you might 
think. There are many thousands of documented cases. Most people who have these kinds 
of encounters rarely report it to UFO groups, so the actual number is likely much 
higher. These cases have been occurring for at least a hundred years and probably much 
longer. They occur all over the world to all kinds of people. This episode presents six 
particularly unusual cases. In each of these cases, the witnesses not only held 
conversations with the ETs, but they were given information that impacted them for the 
rest of their lives.</p>
 
<p>THE ALIEN PLAN. One evening in April 1962, five-year-old Worthington White woke up in his 
grandmother’s home in Quantico, Virginia to see light flooding into his bedroom through 
the attic door. He noticed three short child-like figures standing in the room. One of 
them approached and began to communicate telepathically, downloading information into 
his brain. The next morning, he knew his life would never be the same. In fact, he had 
incredibly ambitious goals and a whole new plan for his life. Growing up, he faced many 
challenges, but the advice given to him by the ETs appeared in his mind and helped chart 
the course of his life, eventually putting him in an incredibly influential career at 
the very top of the US government.</p>

<p>A GRAY SAT NEXT TO ME. One night in June 1963, seventeen-year-old Victor was driving 
along a remote road in Deptford, New Jersey. Without warning, his headlights failed, 
his car engine quit, and he rolled to a stop. A sudden inexplicable and overwhelming 
fear swept through him and he realized someone was sitting next to him in his car. 
Looking over, he was shocked to see a short gray alien. It looked at him with such 
peace that he became instantly calm. In then communicating him with telepathically, 
filling his mind with volumes of information. It then disappeared, but from that 
point on, Victor slowly discovered that the gray had taught him many things.</p>

<p>THE RAINBOW MAN. One afternoon in summer 1974, two brothers, Thomas (age 5) and Kevin 
(age 4) from Needmore, Pennsylvania, noticed a hippy-looking man sit down in their 
backyard. The man began to communicate to them telepathically. Both boys noticed the 
man had a visible aura filled with rainbow colors. The man shared knowledge with them 
about themselves and the universe, taking them on an interactive journey into some of 
Earth’s natural wonders, and teaching them both about their past, present and future 
life. Both were deeply impacted by the encounter and found that the knowledge the man 
shared with them helped to guide them throughout their adult life.</p>

<p>I WAS SO SCARED, I STARTED TO CRY. One night in summer 1988, a young boy, Jose de Diego 
Vazquez, was walking through the Yunque Rain Forest in Puerto Rico as part of a survival 
training course. Strange lights flew overhead and landed behind a large rock. Jose was 
petrified with fear when a male humanoid stepped out and began to speak with him, 
telling him not to be afraid. The figure then used strange symbols to share astounding 
information with the young boy. The man disappeared, and Jose ran back to camp only to 
be faced with a strange mystery. No time had passed during the entire encounter!</p>

<p>THE BLOOD OF THE KINGS. On the night of January 10, 2010, a man heard a strange knocking 
sound on his back door in Toledo Ohio. Going to investigate, he was met by a short gray 
alien. The man invited the gray inside, at which point, a long conversation followed. 
The gray saud they had observed the man since childhood, that they were very interested 
in his genetics, and then proceeded to answer all the witness’s questions, even allowing 
the witness to touch the ET. The ET had some questions of his own. It was an encounter 
that would change the witness’s life.</p>

<p>THE HARVESTERS OF MEMORIES. Ever since he was a young boy, Christopher, a boy from South 
Dakota, had been visited by gray ETs. Usually they stood by his bed and seemed to study 
him. The visits occurred at least twice a year, but doubled when Christopher (who was 
being treated for Aspergers and depression) decided to stop taking prescription medicine. 
Christopher suddenly excelled physically, mentally and creatively. Then, on the night 
of February 26, 2015, he was visited by an 8-foot-tall elder gray who spoke to him 
telepathically, sharing incredible volumes of information about the ETs and their 
mission on Earth, and explained exactly why they found him to be of particular interest 
to them.</p>

<p>These six cases are important because they show that often an encounter with a humanoid 
appears to be an intentional event designed to impart wisdom to an individual to help 
guide them through their lives. They show that extraterrestrial contact can play a very 
powerful role in a person’s life-path.</p>

<p>It is the closest of all UFO experiences: being taken onboard a craft. Cases like these 
represent the frontline of research. They contain more information than any other type 
of UFO encounter and offer the opportunity to answer the many questions that surround 
extraterrestrial contact, such as, who are these mysterious visitors to our planet, 
where do they come from, and why they are here. While some people remain skeptical that 
cases like these take place, the truth is that there are tens of thousands of reports, 
with indications that they may number in the millions. This video presents five 
particularly extensive and lesser-known onboard UFO encounters from across the world-
-cases which involve long interactions and conversations with extraterrestrials. Most 
of the cases involve multiple witnesses, each of who were given amazing information 
about the ETs and/or the future of our planet.</p>

<p>I HAVE NO FEAR. On the night of February 4, 1974, a family of three was camping in a 
remote and isolated area of the vast Sonoran Desert in Mexico. In the middle of the 
night, they were awakened by a beeping noise but couldn’t locate the source. The next 
morning, the mother had the impression that a UFO had visited them in the night. Years 
passed, and they decided to explore the incident under hypnosis. Together, they recalled 
being taken onboard the craft by gray-type ETs. The father was given harrowing 
predictions about the future of humanity. The son recalled being shown strange alien 
symbols. The mother could only recall being led up to the craft. All four say that the 
strange encounter remains one of the most mysterious events of their lives.</p>

<p>I HAD A ROLE TO PLAY. One night in June of 1975, a newly engaged couple were in Minong, 
Pennsylvania when they saw a UFO and experienced a period of missing time. They alerted 
their family who also saw the object. They flashed a light at it, and it flashed back 
and disappeared. Later, the couple realized that they had missing time and went under 
hypnosis. The woman recalled being taken onboard and meeting a glowing being face-to-face. 
He told her that the world was on the verge of catastrophe, and that she had a role to 
play in helping humanity. The man recalled only that the ETs were concerned for the 
world. Both say the encounter was benevolent.</p>

<p>MY WHOLE CONCEPT OF THE UNIVERSE CHANGED. In 1975, Frank Johnson of eastern Pennsylvania 
began meditating in the hopes of making contact with ETs. Immediately, he and his wife 
Alice experienced a series of close-up sightings outside their home. Then, one evening, 
the room lit up and the couple saw a UFO outside. The went outside and were suddenly 
pulled onboard the craft. They saw three human-looking figures in blue jumpsuits. The 
two were separated. The woman was given a physical exam and healed of a chronic 
medical condition. The husband held a long telepathic conversation with the ETs about 
astronomy, other dimensions and humanity. The two were then returned to their home. 
Later the woman had another missing time encounter.</p>

<p>OUR MISSION IS ONE OF PEACE. On the night of January 28, 1978, a man was hiking near Lago 
Vichuquen, Chile when a massive saucer-shaped craft appeared overhead, struck him with a 
beam of light and pulled him into the craft. He was greeted by three human-looking 
figures wearing tan-jumpsuits. Frightened at first, the witness calmed down as the ETs 
explained that they just wanted to speak with him. A very long conversation ensued, 
during which the ETs answered all the man’s questions and offered volumes of information 
about themselves and the history and future of humanity.</p>

<p>A PURE LEARNING EXPERIENCE. At 2am on July 1, 1996, two men were driving near Coates, 
Minnesota when they heard a loud buzzing noise, and saw a glowing craft alongside the 
road. They stopped the car. One of the witnesses exited the car to take a closer look. 
The next thing they knew, hours had passed, they were approaching the next town, and 
it was morning. Later one of the witnesses went under hypnosis. He recalled being 
struck by a blue beam of light and pulled into the craft. He was greeted by two grays 
and a human-looking man. The ETs said that they had brought him onboard to teach him. 
The witness was shown many things and was told that he was part of their “plan” with 
humanity.</p>

<p>The importance of cases like these cannot be understated. The witnesses themselves have 
been deeply changed by their experiences, and the information they have been told 
firsthand by the ETs themselves has profound consequences for all humanity. the five 
cases presented here are just a tiny fraction of the true number of cases. The witnesses 
don’t have the luxury of disbelief. The question is not, are these cases taking place. 
The evidence speaks for itself. The question is, will humanity heed the advice given 
by the ETs?</p>

<p>Welcome to “UFOs in Your Hometown Episode Thirteen,” the continuing investigative series 
which proves that UFOs are being seen everywhere on this planet. This series was born 
from a challenge: name any town, city or location on Earth, and I will find a UFO 
encounter there. And so far, 100% of the locations provided have a history of UFO 
encounters.</p>

<p>Today we explore five new locations, each provided by you, the viewers. 
These locations include Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Pittsburg, California; Attleboro, 
Massachusetts; Oahu, Hawaii and Morganton, NC. These locations not only have been 
visited by UFOs, they have produced the entire range of UFO encounters. Sightings, 
USOs, landings, humanoids, onboard encounters and even a crash/retrieval case. Many 
are supported by compelling evidence: landing traces, medical effects, animal reactions, 
EM disturbances, radar returns and startling photographs. This series proves beyond a 
reasonable doubt that we are not alone in this universe.</p>

<p>PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA. In 1948, military pilots saw strange objects in the skies. 
More sightings occurred in the 1950s, which also produced startling cases of direct 
contact. In 1950, a woman reports that small humanoids entered her home and communicated 
with her telepathically. In 1954, a girl came upon a landed craft and a humanoid. In 
1964, a man was taken onboard a craft and examined. In 1967, a grade-school student 
had a strange encounter with a gray alien who had a profound message for her. Another 
young girl reports she was taken onboard a craft and given a medical exam by grays. In 
1978, more than 200 people observed a large craft moving over the city. On May 5, 1982, 
calls flooded the local police stations from people reporting UFOs. The 1980s brought 
more startling encounters, including a couple who saw a disc over the Birmingham Bridge, 
and man who collided into a UFO while driving. In the years that followed, Pittsburgh 
produced more encounters, making it clear that the city is of great interest to the ETs.</p>

<p>PITTSBURG, CALIFORNIA. This area has produced some very close encounters. In 1977, three 
boys were out hiking when a UFO landed nearby, and three strange humanoids chased them 
for several blocks. In 2009, a man observed a UFO so close to his home, his windows 
vibrated from the humming sound it produced. In 2014, a group of witnesses gathered in a 
McDonald’s Restaurant Parking lot and observed strange craft at very elevation.</p>

<p>ATTLEBORO, MASSACHUSETTS. In addition to many cases of anomalous lights, this city has 
some truly amazing cases. In December 1975, an entire family observed a spherical craft 
hover overhead. Some of them chased after it in their car, and they ended up having 
missing time. In 1981, three sisters called the police after a craft swooped down from 
the sky and buzzed their vehicle. In 1986, a family of four had a frightening encounter 
with a metallic disc which hovered right in front of their car. Unknown to them, numerous 
other people also saw the craft. In 2010, a family saw strange dome-shaped craft while 
driving near the home.</p>

<p>OAHU, HAWAII. This island has a very rich history of encounter. 1924, a young boy had a 
weird encounter with a humanoid on the beach. When a navy officer came upon a landed UFO 
and humanoids in 1944, the case resulted in an apparent retrieval of the craft by the 
military. The 1950s brought a flood of sightings, including a massive wave directly over 
Barber’s Point Naval Air Station. The 1960s and 1970s brought more sightings, several 
more humanoid cases, including onboard UFO encounters complete with profound alien 
messages. There were also some amazing photographic cases. Activity continued with dozens 
of encounters, even as recent as 2023.</p>

<p>MORGANTON, NORTH CAROLINA. This small town has produced several amazing encounters. A 
sighting over the North Carolina School for the Deaf involved more than a dozen 
witnesses. In 1980, a wave of sightings generated numerous calls to the police from 
concerned residents describing metallic craft hovering near their homes. In 1981, two 
young boys had a close-up encounter with a craft that would affect them for the rest 
of their lives. The 1990s brought more startling sightings of solid craft. A truly odd 
case occurred in 2006 when an inmate at the Foothills Correctional Facility reported 
seeing a UFO with humanoids right outside his cell.</p>

<p>This is just a summary of the many significant UFO events that have occurred in these 
locations. Once again, the evidence is undeniable: UFOs are being seen everywhere on 
our planet. The obvious takeaway is UFO encounters are far more common than previously 
believed. And when one considers that the vast majority of people do not report their 
encounters, the actual number of cases must be mindbogglingly huge. It appears that the 
extraterrestrials are conducting a vigorous and well-orchestrated publicity campaign to 
announce their presence.</p>

<p>The onboard UFO experience is the cutting edge of UFO research. It is the closest and 
most extensive of all encounters and holds the greatest potential to assist both 
contactees and researchers to better understand extraterrestrial contact. With tens of 
thousands of documented cases (and indications that they number in the millions) it 
behooves all humanity to take these accounts seriously. They have been occurring for 
over a hundred years, if not longer, come from all over the world, and are supported by 
a wide variety of evidence. This video presents ten extensive onboard encounters. In 
each of these cases, the witnesses were not only taken onboard; they were able to hold 
conversations with the ETs. Each of these cases provides fascinating and profound 
insights into what it’s like to have direct contact with extraterrestrials.</p>

<p>THE DISAPPEARANCE OF ANNI LATTU. In early 1917, the residents of the small village of 
Jyrinvaara, Finland were puzzled by the disappearance of Anni Lattu, who lived in the 
area. When Annie returned, she shocked everyone with her claim that a silver craft had 
landed next to her cottage, and short little beings had taken her onboard. Although 
she was frightened, the humanoids were very friendly and took her on a tour across 
the world and into outer space. They offered her the opportunity to stay with them. 
Annie declined, and they returned her to her home, days later.</p>

<p>I WAS LIFTED INTO THE SKY. In the summer of 1953, Derek (age 5) was walking along a 
remote dirt road near his home in rural Phenix City, Alabama. He was nervous, as he 
had recently twice seen a Bigfoot-like creature in the nearby ravine. This time, he 
was shocked when a beam of light struck him from above and he found himself being 
lifted into the sky toward a metallic craft. Inside, he saw three humanoids, who 
assured him that no harm would come to him. He was returned, but that night, he woke 
up to see three even more unusual creatures in his room.</p>

<p>I WAS BEING WATCHED. In 1961, Joyce Halfin (age 6) was in her bedroom in Ottawa, Canada 
when she saw strange figures by her window. Suddenly she flew up in the sky over her 
house. She blacked out and assumed it must have been a crazy dream. But she knew it 
wasn’t and as she grew up, more encounters occurred. Curious, she tried hypnosis, and 
learned that in 1961, she was taken onboard by praying mantis-type ETs and physically 
examined. Later, she was taken again, and they told her how they pilot their craft and 
other spiritual information.</p>

<p>IT ACTUALLY HAPPENED TO ME. In June 1978, an anonymous high-ranking Soviet officer 
walked along the shore of Lake Pyrogovskoye in the Soviet Union when he was approached 
by two strange men in jumpsuits. They spoke to him telepathically, requested to speak 
with him, and quickly took him onboard a craft. A long conversation followed as the ETs 
answered all his questions. They gave him a demonstration of their craft and even took 
him to their planet. They returned him to Earth and asked him not to speak about his 
encounter.</p>

<p>WE ARE ALL BROTHERS. While hunting near his home in Baependi, Brazil, on May 16, 1979, 
Arlindo Gabriel dos Santos was amazed to see a small, strange object land in a nearby 
forest clearing. It was followed by two more. Then a large craft landed, and short 
humanoids emerged. Afraid, Arlindo turned to flee, but found himself being pulled 
onboard. The ETs held a conversation with him, explaining why they were there and 
where they came from. He was then returned. He suffered many physical symptoms. 
Strange landing traces were found at the site.</p>

<p>WE ARE JUST MEASURING YOU. On the night of May 28, 1991, Susan, a resident of Burien 
Washington, was puzzled by the unexplained barking of her dog. That night, she was 
woken in bed by an eerie blue light streaming through her window. Without warning, 
she found herself lying on a table in a strange room surrounded by gray-type 
extraterrestrials. They gave her a quick physical exam and returned her to her 
bedroom.</p>

<p>I COULDN’T LOOK AWAY. On the night of September 2, 2021, while cutting wood outside 
his home in Wasilla, Alaska, Andrew was puzzled by the appearance of a shining golden 
object in the sky. He became transfixed and started to receive powerful telepathic 
communication. The object moved lower, and he found himself rising upwards and into 
the craft. Inside, he was greeted by three short gray aliens who told him to stay 
calm and began to examine him. Returned 15 minutes later, he knew his life would 
never be the same again.</p>

<p>While some remain skeptical that people are being taken onboard extraterrestrial craft 
and having face-to-face contact with ETs, those who have had this experience don’t have 
the luxury of disbelief. They not only carry the weight of knowing their experiences are 
true but dealing with a society that refuses to accept the reality of ET contact. 
Thankfully things are changing for the better.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting aspects of the UFO phenomenon are humanoid encounters, and 
there are a lot of them. People across the world report a wide variety of humanoids: 
grays, reptilian creatures, human-looking figures, short humanoids and more. While most 
cases go unreported, there is now a worldwide database of many thousands of encounters, 
many supported by multiple eyewitnesses, medical effects, animal reactions, 
electromagnetic disturbances, landing traces and more. In this video we explore seven 
shocking humanoid encounters. In each case the witnesses were thrust into the unknown 
and confronted with something beyond their imagination.</p>

<p>THE LOVELAND HUMANOIDS. At 3:30 am on May 25, 1955, Robert Hunnicutt was driving home 
when he noticed three odd-looking figures standing by the road in Branch Hill, Ohio. He 
stopped his car and was shocked to see that the figures were not human. They had thin 
misshapen bodies and frog-like faces. They turned to look at him and he froze. The next 
thing he knew, he was racing off to the Loveland police station. Unknown to Robert, 
other people had reported UFOs in the area that same evening. This was the first of 
many humanoid and UFO encounters in the area.</p>

<p>SOMETHING HORRIBLE WAS OUT THERE. On the night of November 13, 1967, a young couple drove 
stopped along a forested country road in Surrey, England. Smelling a foul odor, they were 
about to drive off when a strange humanoid appeared next to their car. It had a white 
featureless face and a dark body. The couple drove off in fear. One year later in the 
same area, another young couple experienced a similar encounter. As it turned out, the 
area has a long history of incredible UFO activity and more bizarre humanoid encounters.</p>

<p>I WAS GLUED TO THE GROUND. It was a quiet night on July 22, 1968, at the Pereyra 
Psychiatric Hospital in Mendoza, Argentina as nurse Adela Casalvieri was drawn outside 
by a loud buzzing noise. Stepping into the courtyard, she was immediately struck by a 
red beam of light. The beam retracted and she saw a large craft covered with colored 
lights. Through several portholes she could see humanoid figures moving about. The craft 
darted off, leaving radiation marks on the ground, and burns on Adela’s hands and face. 
Other people saw the craft, and soon many people were reporting UFOs and humanoids.</p>

<p>ETS AT THE ELECTRICAL STATION. On the night of July 23, 1968, security guard Daildo de 
Oliveira was making his rounds at the Central Power Plant in Bauru, Brazil. He noticed 
two men in dark jumpsuits trespassing one of the offices and confronted them. A physical 
fight ensued. A third man appeared, this one dressed in a light jumpsuit. The three 
intruders wrestled Daildo to the ground. Subduing him, they quickly walked off and 
entered a large metallic craft landed on the ground a short distance away. It rose up, 
zigzagged and darted away at high speed.</p>

<p>IT SCARED THE HELL OUT OF ME. On the night of July 19, 1972, a young man was playing 
basketball in the barn next to his home in Pioneer, Michigan when he noticed an intense 
ball of swirling light near him. He watched in shock as the light suddenly elongated and 
out stepped a gray alien. The witness felt a strange pressure in his head as the being 
tried to communicate with him telepathically. He ran off and told his mother. Later 
that night, they both saw a UFO while driving, and later, the boy would have a very 
close-up encounter with a UFO.</p>

<p>THIS CREATURE WAS NOT HUMAN. For the past few nights, “Sarah,” had noticed unusual lights 
near her home in rural Clovis, California. On the morning of November 10, 1986, she 
decided to hike out to the area with her dog to investigate. Suddenly an intense fear 
overwhelmed her for no apparent reason. Her dog was mysteriously gone. Turning around, 
she saw a short gray alien staring at her. It lifted its hand and waved at her. Sarah 
ran home and realized she was missing two hours of time. She forgot the event until one 
year later, when she woke up to find a gray alien in her bedroom.</p>

<p>AN ALIEN BESIDE MY BED. In the middle of the night on August 25, 2022, Natalie woke up in 
her bedroom to see a shadowy figure with a huge head standing by her bed, touching her 
knee. It sent a message telling her not to be afraid. With a shock, Natalie realized it 
was an alien. The figure disappeared. Following the encounter, Natalie discovered that 
she was cured of her chronic insomnia. But following this incident, she began to wake up 
with her clothes on wrong and strange marks on her body. Soon she had another encounter.</p>

<p>These seven humanoid encounters provide a tantalizing glimpse into what it’s like to have 
direct contact with extraterrestrials. And yet they are just the tip of the iceberg. The 
truth about ET contact has been covered up for too long. It’s time for all humanity to 
know that there is other life in the universe. And they find humanity of great interest.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the UFO phenomenon is real. Documented reports of UFOs number 
in the many millions. There is much debate about what they are and where they come from, 
but the evidence is overwhelming that they do exist. The same is true for humanoids. Such 
reports are more rare, but the fact that people are seeing humanoids is undeniable. Cases 
come from all over the world and have been reported for more than a hundred years. This 
video presents ten astonishing cases involving a wide variety of humanoids. These ten 
cases alone provide enough data to offer profound insights into the nature of the 
extraterrestrial presence on our planet.</p>

<p>WE CAN’T LET YOU THROUGH. One day in 1930, a woman was driving to her home in Texas when 
she came upon a saucer-shaped craft landed by the road. Standing in the middle of the 
road was a group of odd humanoids. She held a brief conversation with the strange beings 
and continued on her way, arriving home at midnight. She was missing 14 hours of time.</p>

<p>IT DOESN’T MATTER, IT’S A CHILD. One morning in 1945, Julio (age 13) left his home in 
Lavadores, Spain to fetch a pail of water. He had done this many times, but on this 
occasion, upon reaching the fountain, he was confronted by two strange figures. One 
looked much like Jesus Christ and the other a tall gray ET. He dropped the bucket and 
ran.</p>

<p>THE GESTICULATING EXTRATERRESTRIAL. One day in August 1958, a man stepped outside his 
home in rural Paraibo do Sul, Brazil. A shiny craft dropped from the sky and landed 
nearby. A handsome man with long blond hair and fair skin, wearing a skintight jumpsuit, 
emerged and began to communicate using a series of gestures. Unable to make himself 
understood, he re-entered his craft and left.</p>

<p>THE GLINIK HUMANOIDS. One summer day in 1950, Sofia X stepped outside her home in 
Glinik, Poland and saw an odd-looking man standing in a field. Suddenly he levitated 
into the sky and disappeared. Years later, her 6-year-old son saw a bizarre UFO in the 
same exact spot. It turned out that many people in the small village were seeing UFOs 
and many different types of humanoids.</p>

<p>IT WAS BEAUTIFUL. At 7am on February 15, 1963, Charles Brew and his son milked their 
cows on their farm in Moe, Australia. Hearing an odd noise, Charles saw a silvery craft 
emerge from the clouds and hover above a nearby tree. His farm animals scattered, and 
Charles was amazed to see two humanoid figures in a clear dome on the craft. It darted 
away, leaving Charles with a bad headache.</p>

<p>SOMETHING STRANGE HAPPENED. On the night of July 20, 1968, three teenage girls saw a 
glowing UFO over Lake Kaarnajarv, Estonia. Returning inside, their bedroom filled with 
light, and looking outside they saw a craft hovering nearby. It winked out, but one of 
the girls felt compelled to go outside and saw a female humanoid standing a short 
distance away. Later, weird landing traces were found.</p>

<p>GLOWING ORANGE HUMANOIDS. On the morning of August 24, 1970, three witnesses from 
Olmstead Falls, Ohio, waiting for a bus, saw two humanoids dressed in glowing orange 
jumpsuits and conical hats carrying a strange disc-shaped object over their heads, 
then walk off into a field. Later another witness was found who saw them enter a 
craft. Landing traces were found, and more UFOs were seen in the area.</p>

<p>EYES LIKE BLACK MIRRORS. One night in July 1988, an 8-year-old boy was awoken by 
bright colored lights in his room. Looking outside he saw a strange craft. Suddenly 
the doorway to his room blazed with light and a gray ET appeared. Time seemed to 
stop as two more beings came in and entered his room. As they approached, he 
blacked out. Later he wondered if they had come to cure an ill member of the home.</p>

<p>WE ARE YOUR SISTERS. One summer evening in 1990, a 6-year-old girl woke up when bright 
lights streamed into the bedroom of her home in Langhorne, Pennsylvania. Suddenly, two 
slender shadowy figures entered her bedroom. They were gray ETs. She was unable to move 
as they communicated with her telepathically and conducted a strange exam. It was an 
encounter that changed her life forever.</p>

<p>THE CHILD-LIKE ETS. On December 12, 1997, Jakov Vrancic tended his sheep outside his 
home in Cvrljevo, Croatia. Hearing an odd buzzing sound, he went to investigate and came 
upon a landed UFO and several child-like humanoids with large heads and gray skin. He 
spoke with them for a few minutes until they returned to the craft which took off. Much 
to his dismay, his case brought him unwanted attention.</p>

<p>These ten cases are just a tiny sample of the growing worldwide database of similar 
encounters. While our govts have now admitted to the validity of UFOs, they have yet to 
acknowledge the many humanoid reports. This is strange because these cases represent the 
cutting edge of UFO research. After all, something or someone is inside UFOs. The 
evidence points towards UFOs being craft piloted by extraterrestrials.</p>

<p>Of all types of UFO encounters, the most extensive and profound are cases where people 
are taken onboard a craft and interact with extraterrestrials face-to-face. Thousands of 
these cases from across the planet have been documented, though many researchers believe 
they number in the millions. These cases have the most information and hold the greatest 
potential to answer many of the questions surrounding extraterrestrial contact. This 
video presents seven onboard UFO encounters. These cases involve many different types 
of ETs and they provide a fascinating glimpse into who these beings are, where they come 
from and why they are visiting our planet.</p>

<p>THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF ALBERT LANCASHIRE. One evening in 1942, 27-year-old army 
officer, Albert Lancashire, stood in the guard booth at a secret radar site near 
Newbiggen-by-the Sea, England. Suddenly a light appeared and moved towards him, showing 
itself to be a disc-shaped craft. The craft struck him with a beam of light, and he 
passed out. When he awoke, the craft was gone. This was followed by UFO dreams, 
paranormal events and another UFO sighting. After many years, he recalled being lifted 
into the craft, examined, and then returned.</p>

<p>THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF PAMELA WIMMER. In 1975, Pamela Wimmer (age 22) was at her 
home in Dresden, Maine when she heard her child scream from the front yard. She ran 
outside and saw a huge saucer-shaped craft. It moved off, but it reminded her that, at 
age 10, she and a friend were chased home by a craft. At age 14, three small grays pulled 
her from her bed, into a craft parked in front of her house. Inside, she was given a 
physical exam, saw weird star-charts, and was shown the Earth floating in space. The ETs 
asked her if she would like to go with them. Pamela declined, and they brought her home.</p>

<p>THE ONBOARD ENCOUNTER OF SUSAN. In 1968, “Susan,” (age 9) was playing with friends near 
their homes in Port Augusta, South Australia when they saw odd lights hovering overhead. 
One year later, she was in her bedroom in Adelaide when three short figures and one tall 
one arrived and pulled her onboard a craft. She was physically examined. They showed her 
images of a planet experiencing a worldwide disaster. They told her that she had 
important work to do on Earth. This was the first of many encounters, including a few 
involving intimate relations with a tall gray.</p>

<p>THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF ROBERLA T. Stepping on to the porch of her Phoenix Arizona 
home on the night of June 23, 1973, Roberla saw a star-like light descending. As it 
approached, she saw it was a strange craft. A door opened and she could see a tall 
humanoid figure. She passed out. Years later, she went under hypnosis and recalled that 
the figure approached her and levitated her into the craft where she was physically 
examined.</p>

<p>THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF FRANCESCO OJEDA. On March 3, 1976, twelve-year-old Francesco 
Ojeda went missing near his home in rural Fortaleza, Brazil. Two days later, he was found 
by his parents wandering in the forest, burned and unable to see. He recovered his sight. 
He said that while walking home from school, he came upon a landed craft and two small 
humanoids. They entered into the craft which stuck him with a beam of light. He passed 
out and woke up onboard the craft. The ETs examined him, said they meant him no harm, 
and told him that ETs were visiting Earth in large numbers.</p>

<p>THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF DR SIMON TAYLOR & REZA. On September 16, 1976, Simon Taylor 
and his friend Reza went camping tin the Elburz Mountains near Tehran, Iran. In the 
middle of the night they were woken up by three dark-suited figures with large eyes who 
led them into a craft. Inside they sat on a Persian rug while the craft took them on a 
tour around planet Earth. They were returned miles from where they were taken. Both 
were forever changed by their shared encounter.</p>

<p>THE ONBOARD ENCOUNTER UFO ENCOUNTER OF TATIANA MIKHAYLOVONA. Walking to her home in 
Protvino, Russia, on the evening of September 13, 1989, Tatiana Mikhalovona was 
startled by two tall women in silver jumpsuits who approached her. She was unable to 
resist as they led her to a landed flying saucer and took her onboard. They asked if 
she’d like to go for a short ride. Tatiana didn’t want to, but the beings convinced her. 
Tatiana was amazed when she looked out of the porthole of the craft and saw the city 
lights below her. After a 10-minute ride, they returned her to Earth and promised to 
meet her again.</p>

<p>These seven cases are just the tip of the iceberg, but these alone provide an accurate 
representation of what it’s like to be taken onboard an ET craft and meet ETs face-to-
face. There are so many cases with remarkable commonalities, coming from all over the 
world, that they are impossible to deny or explain away. They provide powerful testimony 
that we are being visited by a wide variety of beings from beyond Earth.</p>

<p>Welcome to “UFOs in Your Hometown: Episode Twelve,” the ongoing UFO investigative series 
exploring a wide variety of locations on Earth, proving that every town and city on this 
planet has been visited by extraterrestrials. More than 100 locations have been explored, 
and all have a long and rich history of UFO encounters. Sightings, landings, humanoids, 
onboard encounters and more are all represented. Name any place on the globe, and you can 
find an encounter there. In this episode we explore nine new locations: Paducah, 
Kentucky; Shakopee, Minnesota; Wilton, Maine; Doncaster, UK; Myrtle Beach, South 
Carolina; Bensalem, Pennsylvania and Brigantine, New Jersey.</p>

<p>PADUCAH, KENTUCKY. In 1957, two men saw a UFO which caused their car to stall. In 1993, a 
family saw three metallic UFOs circling over their home. In 2005, a man saw a huge black 
triangle at very low elevation. In 2008, a young man saw a classic flying saucer right 
outside his window, an encounter which triggered profound changes in his life.</p>

SHAKOPEE, MINNESOTA. In 2005 and 2013, two separate encounters occurred while the 
witnesses drove along the freeway and saw craft overhead. In 2015, a witness observed a 
brilliant object overhead and managed to capture a photograph of it. In broad daylight 
in 2006, a man saw a massive bell-shaped craft far too large to be any conventional 
craft.</p>

<p>WILTON, MAINE. On October 16, 2004, a mother noticed a strange static interference on 
her baby monitor. Going outside, she was amazed to see a string of colored lights 
hovering over the field behind her house. Her husband saw it too, and both became so 
uneasy, they fled inside.</p>

<p>DONCASTER, UNITED KINGDOM. In 1975, three boys saw a UFO so low, they thought it would 
land. In 1975, a family saw a UFO hover in the field behind their home. In 1980, 1988, 
1997 and 1998 each produced high quality UFO sightings that researchers couldn’t explain. 
In one case the UFO was so low, the witness could smell it.</p>

<p>MYRTLE BEACH, SOUTH CAROLINA. In 1952, a man saw a UFO over his farm and shot it with his 
gun. Days later, a reporter and his family saw apparently the same craft. In 1975, a man 
saw a classic saucer flying along the shoreline in broad daylight. In 2013, a couple saw 
a UFO after a fireworks display. In 2017 and 2022, two cases involved photographic evidence.</p>

<p>PARKERSBURG, WEST VIRGINIA. In 1949, a pilot reported a near-miss with a UFO. In 1956, 
there were two cases of very unusual lights over the city. In 1966, two men reported a 
craft landing in front of their car and a face-to-face encounter with the UFO occupant. 
That same year, there was a UFO display involving a fleet of seven saucers. In 1978, 
more than a dozen police officers and hundreds of citizens saw UFOs.</p>

<p>MACON, GEORGIA. In 1950, the military dismissed eyewitness reports of speeding white 
objects in the night sky. In 1951, a military pilot encountered a UFO which played 
cata-and-mouse games with his aircraft for more than 10 minutes. One year later, 
multiple pilots saw a UFO by their planes. In 1955, there were at least two sightings 
of strange craft overhead. In 1957, three truck drivers encountered an egg-shaped 
object on the highway. In 1958 there was a sighting directly over Robin AFB. And one 
year later in 1959, more than 500 people reported unusual lights in the sky. In 1973, 
a woman reported her encounter with a landed UFO and strange beings in the forest 
outside of Macon. And in 1973, a rash of sightings involved more than a dozen police 
officers who were vehement that they had seen UFOs. Sightings continued in 2018 and 
2019.</p>

<p>BENSALEM, PENNSYLVANIA. A very interesting case in Bensalem involved a couple who, in 
1973, saw a boomerang-shaped craft and moments later, a dogman-like creature. In 1975, 
a man photographed a UFO almost identical to a photo published by J. Allen Hynek. In 
1977, a family had a prolonged encounter with a classic flying saucer which resulted 
in direct contact. Another case in 1989 involved a witness who himself was a UFO 
investigator.</p>

<p>BRIGANTINE, NEW JERSEY. In 1953, a man saw a mothership come over the water and release 
several smaller craft. In 2015, a man had so many encounters with strange orbs, he 
finally was able to capture them on video. In 2019, a man saw a massive craft over the 
town which was nearly invisible in the night sky.</p>

<p>So many locations, so many cases, and so many firsthand eyewitnesses! The deeper you 
look, the more cases you find. The truth is undeniable: UFOs are being seen everywhere 
on this planet. And the implications of this are profound. It means that UFO encounters 
are far more common than previously believed. It means that UFOs are apparently 
conducting a vigorous publicity campaign announcing their presence. And most important 
of all, it means that we are not alone, and UFOs are real!</p>

<p>Welcome to Episode Eleven of the ongoing series: UFOs in Your Hometown. This series was 
born from a challenge: name any town, city or location on this planet, and I will find at 
least one UFO encounter there. With nearly 100 locations explored from across the planet, 
every single one shows a long, rich history of UFO encounters of all kinds: sightings, 
landings, humanoids, onboard cases and more. We now explore four new locations: Vancouver, 
BC, Canada; Lake Havasu, Arizona; Thomasville, North Carolina and Isle of Wight, United 
Kingdom. All types of encounters are represented, along with a wide variety of evidence: 
medical effects, landing traces, electromagnetic disturbances, animal reactions, radar-
returns, photographs and more. So come along on a journey that is sure to change the 
way you feel about the UFO phenomenon.</p>

<p>VANCOUVER, BC, CANADA. In 1912, a farm-boy came upon a landed UFO with humanoids. In 1933, 
after a wave of sightings, witnesses observed an apparent UFO crash and alien bodies. Year 
after year, Vancouver has sightings of solid metallic craft, in 1939, 1955, 1964, 1968 and 
more. In 1968, a group of boys came upon a landed UFO and a humanoid on a golf course. In 
1970, a man describes his encounter with a fleet of tiny UFOs. In 1977, a mother and 
daughter saw a flying saucer hover right over a church. That same year, two weather 
observers at Vancouver Int’l Airport saw a huge craft with portholes. In 1978, neighbors 
saw a closeup UFO hover over their homes. In 1985, a classroom of students and a teacher 
saw a strange craft hover over the schoolyard. In 1990, a child saw a gray ET in his hotel 
room. In 1997, a woman’s sighting of a craft drew the attention of NORAD. That same year, 
a lady and her grandson had a dramatic encounter with a hamburger-shaped UFO. In 2000, 
two amateur astronomers were shocked by their sighting of a V-shaped craft. In April and 
May of 2001, two brothers had three close-up sightings; one of the witnesses had telepathic 
communication. More dramatic sightings of metallic discs occurred in 2001 and 2003. In 2015, 
a Vancouver woman reported her encounter with a strange humanoid in her bedroom.</p>

<p>LAKE HAVASU, ARIZONA. In 1968, a daylight disc was seen directly over Lake Havasu. The 
best-known sighting in this area occurred in 1968 when two Cessna pilots saw dozens of 
craft performing fantastic maneuvers. In 1994, a woman and her child had an encounter 
with a massive UFO over their house. They could see humanoids through the portholes. 
When the humanoids entered their house, they packed up and moved away.  In 1996, a 
group of witnesses saw a glowing green craft, resulting in missing time. More amazing 
cases of solid craft encounters occurred in 2000, 2005 and 2006. In 2009, a witness 
videotaped a solid metallic disc hovering over Lake Havasu in broad daylight. In 2010, 
an entire family observed a UFO being chased by military jet aircraft. This is just a 
small sample of UFOs seen over the Lake Havasu area, proving once again that UFOs are 
seen everywhere.</p>

<p>THOMASVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA. In 1965 a man had a very close encounter with a cylindrical 
craft hovering only 200 feet above the ground. One night in 1969, two independent 
witnesses pulled off the road to observe a classic flying saucer hover over the nearby 
trees. When a strange humanoid appeared in one of the windows, they drove off in a panic. 
Arriving home, one of the witnesses realized he was missing about 45 minutes of time. 
One night in 1996, a man was driving along the road when he saw a UFO sending down a 
beam of light in the field next to him. Soon the UFO zoomed towards him, coming directly 
over his vehicle. In 1998, a father and son fishing on a lake had a very close encounter 
with a silver spherical craft. So many cases!</p>

<p>ISLE OF WIGHT, UNITED KINGDOM. So many cases here. In 1952, an RAF radarman tracked 8 
objects flying over the Isle of Wight. In 1954, a UFO was seen over a wide area. In 1956 
two jet fighter pilots chased a UFO along the coast, catching it on radar. In 1959, a 
group of 8 amateur astronomers observed 5 “mystery satellites.” In 1961, a mother and 
daughter had a very close encounter with a metallic disc. In 1967, a group of students 
saw a wobbling UFO behind their school, leaving behind landing traces. In 1970, a man 
had a series of sightings. Three years later, his daughter and a friend had a bizarre 
humanoid encounter with the “Sandown Clown,” destined to become the area’s most famous 
case. Over the next decades, year after year, many other sightings occurred, some which 
were investigated by the Royal Air Force.</p>

<p>So many cases of all kinds. The ubiquitous nature of UFOs cannot be denied. If every 
location on this planet has truly been visited by UFOs, the implications of this are 
profound. UFOs appear to be putting on a publicity campaign announcing their presence. 
The ETs have done their part to disclose. The rest is up to us.</p>

<p>Being taken onboard a UFO! It is the ultimate type of UFO encounter, the most extensive, 
and the most controversial. There are thousands of cases on record. These cases have the 
greatest potential to answer the many questions surrounding the extraterrestrial presence 
on our planet, such as who are these strange visitors, where do they come from and why 
are they here? This video presents five little known cases coming from all over the world. 
In each of these cases, the witnesses held long conversations with the extraterrestrials. 
Each of these cases was investigated by researchers. The five cases here add to the 
growing database of close encounters of the fourth kind, making it increasingly undeniable 
that we are being visited by extraterrestrials.</p>

<p>TIME DOESN’T EXIST. One night in April 1970, lawyer, Raymond Shearer, (pseudonym) was 
driving outside Madison, Wisconsin and saw a light over his car. He felt compelled to 
turn off on a remote road and came upon an ET craft. Suddenly, it was morning, and he 
was arriving home. Beset with anxiety, he visited a therapist. Making no progress, the 
therapist tried hypnosis, and recalled that he was taken onboard a craft by human-
looking ETs who examined him and said that humans do not understand the nature of time, 
how they fly their craft, that humans are too warlike for open contact, and that the 
ETs have lost some of their people to conflicts with humans. They talked about the 
power of water and many other topics, including advising Raymond about his career.</p>

<p>WE ARE YOUR FRIENDS. On February 28, 1974, Dirant Mello Ferraz (age 18) was in his home 
in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil when he was pulled into a craft. Onboard, he met a twin of 
himself who departed the craft and took Dirant’s place for a full 24-hours, learning 
all he could about life on Earth. Meanwhile Dirant was kept onboard. He asked the ETs 
many questions, which they answered, about why they chose him, what their mission on 
Earth was, would they invade our planet, did they believe in God, and much more. They 
asked him to tell the people of Earth that they are friendly and that it is their 
mission to help humanity. After 24 hours, Dirant was returned to his home. Dirant’s 
case was thoroughly researched, but afterward, he just wanted to forget about the 
encounter and live a normal life.</p>

<p>THE PEOPLE OF EARTH AREN’T READY. On December 25, 1976, an anonymous teacher, “Francisco,” 
was hunting outside of Merida, Spain when he became tired and fell asleep. Waking up, it 
was night, and he realized a weird tentacle-like device was pulling on his arm. To his 
shock, it was attached to a strange craft a short distance away. He fainted and when 
he awoke, he thought he was in a hospital. But when big-eyed, scaly-skinned creatures 
entered, he realized he was inside a craft. After examining him, they gave him a tour 
of the craft, showed him an alien arboretum, and fed him strange alien foods. They 
said they were on a benevolent scientific expedition to study Earth, that their 
culture is far older than ours, that humans are not ready for contact, and that it 
was his duty to tell the world about them.</p>

<p>THE MOST IMPORTANT ATTRIBUTE OF MATTER. At 9pm on September 20, 1979, two men in Sztum, 
Poland were shocked to see a UFO hover overhead. Suddenly they found themselves flying 
upward into the craft. Inside, each held telepathic conversations with unseen entities 
who talked on various topics such as mathematics, physics, the nature of matter and more. 
Suddenly they were deposited back onto the ground and watched the craft dart away. Both 
men had severe headaches. They tried to share their experience with friends, who 
ridiculed them. Later, their case was extensively studied, and it was learned that one 
year earlier, another truly remarkable encounter had occurred in the same area.</p>

<p>WE WON’T DO YOU ANY HARM. On the night of January 12, 2008, the Voronezhsky family were 
puzzled by the appearance of strange lights above their home in Dubno, Ukraine. Going 
to bed, they were awakened in the middle of the night by a light illuminating their home. 
Rushing outside, they saw a giant craft overhead. Suddenly the parents, Vladimir and 
Olga, were pulled up into the craft. Vladimir was unable to move as his wife was 
examined. The gray-type ETs were very polite as they told the couple about ET society, 
and their interest in human emotions. They said that they were able to travel great 
distances, turn their ships invisible and much more. They gave the couple a tour through 
space and then returned them home. Vladimir discovered he had greater strength and 
endurance, and Olga was healed of colitis.</p>

<p>Five onboard experiences, each with amazing similarities and unique details, each 
providing further evidence of extraterrestrial intervention on planet Earth. It is 
unknown exactly how many people have had an experience like this, but some researchers 
believe it may number in the millions.</p>

<p>Welcome to Episode Ten of UFOs in Your Hometown. The challenge continues: name any 
town or city in the world, and I will find a UFO encounter there! This includes sighting, 
landings, humanoids and onboard encounters. It appears that the UFO occupants are 
conducting a carefully orchestrated and vigorous publicity campaign, visiting every 
location on Earth, in an apparent attempt to announce their presence. In this latest 
installment, we explore four new locations: Slovakia; Covington, Kentucky, Chicago, 
Illinois and Sarasota, Florida. These four locations alone represent a microcosm of UFO 
activity, containing enough cases to provide an accurate representation of the UFO 
phenomenon. There are cases with multiple witnesses, landing traces, medical effects, 
animal reactions, electromagnetic disturbances, photographs, radar returns, and more. 
So come along on a journey that is sure to change the way you feel about UFOs.</p>

<p>SLOVAKIA: In 1944, a physician observed a fleet of 8 UFO. In 1959, Air Force officers and airport employees viewed an object hover over an airfield and was caught on radar. In December 1967, many people in the small village of Myjava saw a UFO appeared directly above the local church. In 1971, three people were taken from their apartment to what they believed to be another planet. Slovakia’s most famous encounter occurred in 1987 when a helicopter crew chased a UFO over the Vranov reservoir. In 1997, the residents of the small town of Milicin were panicked by a very intense wave of encounters. In 1991 and 1992, more sightings were viewed by police and caught on radar. The years of 1993 and 1994 were particularly active, with landings, multiple face-to-face encounters with humanoids and a gentleman whose car was levitated into the sky. In 2005 and 2006, multiple low-level sightings over the Bohunice and Temelin Nuclear power stations caused concern at high levels of government.</p>

<p>COVINGTON, KENTUCKY. In July 1947, residents observed a UFO with landing legs flying at very low elevation over the city. In 1956, a pilot had no less than three encounters. In 1959, police were flooded with calls about a UFO and a strange creature. In 1975, a gentleman in a high-rise building watched a UFO fly around his building. In 1976, a UFO hovered over the suburb, sending down a beam of light. In 1978, people across the city described a glowing green object, and some reported seeing it land. In 1985, police across Covington saw a UFO which was also caught on radar. In 2017, a Covington resident reported an object which hovered for hours, causing a bizarre electromagnetic disturbance in his home.</p>

<p>CHICAGO, ILLINOIS. Numerous low-level sightings occurred in 1952, including one viewed by police over two radio towers. In 1954, witnesses observed a UFO hover and then land on the shores of Lake Michigan, disgorging a small humanoid. 1954 produced several other cases, including a low-level sighting over an oil refinery. In 1957, policemen saw a UFO hovering directly over a cemetery. 1963 brought sightings of classic UFOs with portholes moving only a few hundred feet overhead and seen by hundreds of people. In 1965, a man walking along the shores of Lake Michigan came upon a landed UFO with a little spaceman standing next to it. Dramatic and widely viewed sightings occurred regularly, in 1966, 1973, 1978-79, and 1988. In 1990, a witness reported a low-level encounter with a craft that caused odd physiological effects. In 1999, a man was visited in his home by a 7-foot-tall mantid.</p>

<p>SARASOTA, FLORIDA. In 1952, a UFO skeptic changed his tune when a UFO zigzagged over his home. In 1953, two men had saw a UFO following several B36 aircraft, and then zoom towards them and hover overhead. In January 1954, Pulitzer Prize-winning author, MacKinley Kantor saw a UFO and took it to the highest levels of government. The years of 1957, 1958 and 1960 brought many undeniable UFO encounters over the city. In 1969, and again in 1976, waves of activity were viewed by many residents who were left with no explanation for what they saw. In 1985, authorities were flooded with calls as a wave of activity occurred over the city, with some seeing an object diving into the bay. In 1995, a pilot and his passenger flying in their Cessna reported a near-collision with a bright glowing object. In 1995, residents of a home on the outskirts of Sarasota discovered a strange glowing stone in their yard, which ended up causing severe repercussions. In 1999 and 2005, witnesses driving through the area saw UFOs at treetop level moving overhead. In 2022, a man not only saw a fleet of 8 disc-shaped objects, he took photographs!</p>

<p>As can be seen, UFOs are ubiquitous. They are being seen all over this planet. This is important as it reveals that the ETs appear to have an agenda to announce their presence to all humanity. The ETs have done their part to disclose their presence. The rest is up to us!</p>

<p>Joe Gardner (an artist from Huntington, West Virginia) was five years old when he had his first strange encounter. It was 1974 and he and his mother stood in the parking lot of the local Foodland grocery store. Suddenly Joe heard a singsong voice speak s in his mind, “Joe-Joe. Joe-Joe.” Looking up he saw a shiny metallic cylindrical object floating overhead. He pointed it out to his mother who also saw it. So began Joe’s life of high strangeness. Following this, he and his entire family had a dramatic missing time encounter with a landed UFO. A few years later, Joe had another onboard encounter. But for various reasons, both these events became buried in his mind and shrouded in forgetfulness.</p>

<p>Years later, on January 22, 1997, Joe (now 22) had a dramatic sighting of a green orb arcing across the pre-dawn sky. Two years later, on the night of April 7, 1999, he was walking his dog when a glittering diamond-shaped object appeared. Joe sent out a telepathic message, “Who are you?” The response was instantaneous: “No, not now!” Joe felt an overwhelming sense of love coming from the object. These two sightings sent Joe on a journey of awakening and discovery. It was then that he remembered the sighting at age five, and the two other major experiences that followed.</p>

<p>It was just a few months after the sighting at the Foodland grocery store that Joe’s family (father, mother, sister and Joe) went for a blackberry hunting trip into nearby Kentucky. It was early afternoon, and they drove along the backroads when Joe’s father pointed out a weird-looking “spaceship house” sitting on stilts a few hundred feet off the highway. It was shiny, metallic, with portholes around the circumference. Joe begged his father to stop. They pulled off the road. Joe’s father and Joe got out and walked up to the object. There was no driveway, no telephone wires. Joe’s father knocked on the side of it, and suddenly an opening appeared, an arm stuck and gestured, and voice said, “Up here!” At the time of the incident, the next thing Joe and his father knew, they were back in the car, driving home. But now, years later, Joe recalled that they actually went onboard.</p>

<p>A small ladder came down and Joe and his father climbed up into the object. Joe immediately saw a humanoid figure with a large bald head, huge darks eyes and a skinny body. He looked more like a bug than a human, though his father didn’t seem to notice. While the man and Joe’s father talked, the being motioned Joe to a table where there were small black wafers and a tumbler filled with green liquid. Joe thought it was chocolate cookies and juice and took a bite of the cookie. It was bitter, so he took a sip of the juice and promptly passed out.</p>

<p>Joe awoke to find himself lying on a metal table while his father sat on a small bench, apparently in a trance. An unpleasant physical exam followed, and again, Joe lost consciousness. He awoke to see a tall gray-type ET, who asked Joe if he’d like a tour of the craft. Joe was taken to another room where he saw his family sitting unmoving in separate chairs, with all kinds of activity going on around them. Becoming upset, the gray told him, telepathically, not to be afraid, that it was just a checkup. Reassured, the being then took Joe up to a room where he saw a field of stars.</p>

<p>Joe’s next memory is being in the car driving home. His whole family was upset. His father cursed angrily, and both his mother and sister were crying. When they arrived home, they discovered they were missing almost ten hours. Joe was the only one who had some recall of being taken onboard. After a visit by a Man in Black, Joe’s father forbade him to talk about it ever again.</p>

<p>Three years later, at age eight, Joe woke up in his bedroom to hear his name being called inside his head. Looking outside, he saw a landed craft with a man on top. “Do you want to go for a ride?” the man asked telepathically. Joe said yes, and he snuck out of the house into the craft. He was met by a human-looking man in a jumpsuit who took him to the control room, sat him in the seat and off they went, up over the city, over the earth, and the next thing Joe knew, he was looking at the planet Saturn. The experience was entirely benevolent. Returning Joe to his home, the man urged Joe to study hard at school and tell nobody about the encounter.</p>

<p>Now, as an adult, Joe began having many close-up UFO sightings and was able to take photographs of a few of them. He learned his mom had a missing time encounter. He experienced a wide variety of paranormal events, including another episode of telepathic communication. Then on April 3, 2007, Joe had a truly bizarre encounter with a blue-skinned humanoid that changed his entire outlook about his experiences, and he wondered if perhaps they weren’t ETs at all, but more akin to Djinns.</p>

<p>The general public has no idea how common humanoid encounters are. There are not hundreds 
of cases, but many thousands, perhaps more than that. Cases go back more than 100 years 
and come from across the world. The coverup is one reason cases like these are thought 
of as rare. Another is that an encounter with a humanoid can be so strange that people 
are reluctant to report it for fear of being disbelieved or ridiculed. Still, many people 
have found the courage to come forward. Almost everything we know about UFOs and ETs 
comes from these reports. This episode presents twelve cases from 1940-2013, occurring 
across the planet, involving a wide variety of humanoids.</p>
 
<p>TALL HUMANOIDS IN GLOWING METALLIC OUTFITS. Sometime in the early 1940s, police sergeant 
Vicente Pedone was stationed in Oriente, Buenos Aires, Argentina when a local resident 
reported a strange aircraft seemingly coming in for a crash-landing. Going to 
investigate, they saw a landed craft with tall humanoids next to it. Fear soon 
caused them to flee the scene.</p>

<p>THE CLOUDED CRAFT. Early one night in 1952, a group of stoneworkers near the Nimes-
Courbessac Airport in France saw a strange cloud approach. In moments, it revealed itself 
to be a solid metallic craft with portholes. And through the portholes they saw 5 or 6 
figures inside. The craft darted away, again hidden by clouds. Other people saw the 
object too.</p>

<p>A UFO DRIVE-BY, WITH HUMANOIDS. One night in October 1957, a couple driving through the 
Store Vildmose Bog near Aalborg, Denmark saw a bright light zooming towards them just 
above the ground. In moments, it was right next to them. They now saw it was a craft 
with a glass-like dome on top, and seated inside were two uniformed men. Afraid, the 
wife insisted they flee.</p>

<p>THEY LOOKED JUST LIKE PEOPLE…BUT THEY WEREN’T. At 9pm on December 18, 1977, Bruno 
Nygard was walking to his home in Sahavaara, Sweden and saw a strange craft floating 
above the road. As it approached, he saw two short men sitting on top. The two men 
hopped off and began picking up things from the road. Seeing Bruno, they hopped back 
onto their ship and zoomed off.</p>

<p>IT WAS NOT HUMAN. On the night of August 7, 1979, two women driving near Duluth, Minnesota 
saw three short figures on the road ahead of them. They appeared at first to be children. 
Then two seemed to float off the road, but the third stood in the road, blocking their 
way. The witnesses stopped their car and stared in shock: it was not human. After 10 
scary minutes, they drove off.</p>

<p>NINE-FOOT-TALL HUMANOIDS. On February 12, 1980, during a wave of sightings near 
Algeciras, Spain, a couple and three children drove up to where the lights were 
being seen. They came upon a landed UFO and two 9-foot-tall humanoids. When the 
figures began to approach, they fled in their car. To their shock, the figures 
chased them in their car.</p>

<p>REALLY SCARED, BUT ALSO CURIOUS. One summer evening in 1981, a woman was driving 
to her home in rural Utah when her car broken down. Walking the remaining 2 miles 
home, a UFO flew over her head then landed in the road in front of her. Out 
stepped a little man. She approached and waved at the being. A bright light 
flashed, and she fainted. When she awoke, the craft and humanoid were gone.</p>

<p>IT WAS GONE WITHIN SECONDS. In August 1983, a wave of UFO activity struck central Puerto 
Rico. Many people had close-up sightings of strange craft. Among the strangest was a man 
who saw a pyramid-shaped object. It had windows on one side, and looking down at him were 
three humanoids.</p>

<p>MINIATURE UFO AND HUMANOID. One spring day in 1984, a young boy was walking through a 
field near his home in Vancouver, Washington when he came upon a 3-foot-wide metallic 
disc with a clear dome on top. Inside it was a tiny humanoid. The boy picked up the 
craft, which emitted a buzzing noise, broke free from his grip and darted off into the sky.</p>
 
<p>WHAT I SAW WAS FOUR FEET TALL. Late one night on March 20, 1997, a man from Port Perry, 
Ontario, Canada, was shocked to see grays inside his home. They had skinny bodies and 
looked reptilian. One moved its arms up and down in slow motion. The man thinks he may 
have had missing time.</p>

<p>WE CAN FIND YOU. One night in mid-January 2007, a man stepped out from his work in New 
Orleans, Louisiana for a quick smoke. He heard an odd beeping noise. Then a strange fear 
filled him and looking up, he saw a gray entity floating in the sky above him.</p>

<p>THE GRAY IN THE BEDROOM. On April 11, 2013, a woman entered her parents’ bedroom in 
Catania, Italy, and saw her mother levitating and a gray standing next to her. Filled 
with fear, she ran into the bathroom and locked the door. Soon other odd events began 
to occur.</p>

<p>Twelve cases, each adding to the growing database of human encounters, each making it 
increasingly difficult to deny the truth of the UFO phenomenon. Sooner or later, all 
humanity will become aware that we are not alone in this universe.</p>

<p>Welcome to Episode Nine of UFOs in Your Hometown. Name any town or city on this 
planet, and you will find a history of UFOs. So far I have examined almost 100 
locations, and every single one of them has been visited by UFOs. The implications 
of this are profound; this shows that UFO encounters are far more common than previously 
believed. It appears that the UFO occupants are conducting a  publicity campaign and 
want to be seen. This latest episode of the ongoing series presents nine new locations 
including: Katwijk, Holland; Nanjing, China; Pakistan; Quapaw, Oklahoma; Salinas, 
California; Dubque, Iowa; Daytona Beach, Florida; Statesville, North Carolina; and 
Annadale, New York. Sightings, landings, face-to-face encounters and more…they are 
occurring everywhere on Earth.</p>

<p>KATWIJK, HOLLAND. This small town of about twelve square miles has a couple of very interesting encounters. At 3:30 am on July 8, 2003, a woman noticed a spinning disc-shaped craft over her home. It remained in place for an hour. Afterwards, she had a terrible headache. On September 2, 2023, a witness not only saw a UFO, but photographed and filmed it.</p>

<p>NANJING, CHINA. One of Nanjing’s earliest sightings occurred in 1892 and was widely-viewed and memorialized in a painting. In 1999, a glowing red cylindrical object hovered for four hours over the city. In 2002, three separate pilots witnessed an unidentified craft moving through the skies. In 2009, during a solar eclipse, scientists observed and photographed a glowing object.</p>

<p>PAKISTAN. In 1952, the Reuters News Service reported on a sighting in Karachi involving four flying saucers. Per a CIA document, UFOs were seen in 1953. In 1955, UFOs hovered over an airport. Also in 1955, thousands of witnesses who saw a craft with humanoids inside it. A sighting of a bright red disc occurred in 1956, and in 1969, Army intelligence officers in Peshawar saw three discs in the sky. They were sworn to silence. In 1986 a group of witnesses saw 8 objects. In 2002, Pakistani pilots had a close encounter with a UFO.</p>

<p>QUAPAW, OKLAHOMA. This tiny town is well-known for mysterious spook-lights. It also has UFO encounters. In 1972, a couple witnessed three UFOs hover over their home for over an hour. In 2006, a witness driving through Quapaw saw a silver cigar-shaped object hover and dart off at high speed. In 2014, a witness saw a UFO so close, he heard it humming.</p>

<p>SALINAS, CALIFORNIA. In 1945, an army officer  at Salinas Army Airbase saw three flying disks. In 1947, a farmer saw a metallic disc-shaped craft in his field. It was quickly nabbed by the US military. In 1950, a mini-wave caused many people to call the police. In 1950 and 1952, a UFO hovered over two different factories. In 1967, a couple saw a  disc with portholes. In 1972, a man saw a gigantic UFO which prompted memories of being visited by humanoids. 1978 brought a multi-witness case of UFOs over the airport; a 7-year-old who saw a UFO and had missing time; five boys who had a close-up sighting; and a landing of a UFO at a high school. Cases in 1981 and 2002 involved communication with the UFO occupants. In 2013, a filmed UFO sighting and crop circle brought wide publicity. More sightings occurred in 2014 and in 2019, a weird humanoid encounter.</p>

<p>DUBUQUE, IOWA. So many cases here! In 1880, a woman claimed a bizarre encounter with fairies. In 1947, a couple saw metallic discs over their home. In 1952, a man had an odd encounter while driving outside the city. In 1960, a pilot filmed three UFOs over Dubuque. Many others saw the objects. In 1967 two families saw an egg-shaped craft. More sightings occurred in 1972, 1977 and 1982. In 1996, a teenage boy had a closeup UFO sighting and missing time. 2002 brought two more sightings, including one by two pilots.</p>

<p>DAYTONA BEACH, FLORIDA. Sightings of metallic discs occurred in 1950 and 1952. In 1957, a lady says a UFO paced her car. In 1959, two pilots had a near-collision with a UFO. In 1964, a man saw a UFO with twelve humanoids inside it. In 2008, a father and son saw strange orbs hovering over the ocean. In 2023, a couple saw and filmed V-shaped craft over Daytona Beach.</p>

<p>STATESVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA. In 1955, a trained observer saw three discs cavorting playfully in the sky. In 1986, a father and son saw a massive metallic craft land in their corn field, and through the windows they could see many humanoid figures.</p>

<p>ANNADALE, NEW YORK. In 1975 two boys walking in the forest saw a glowing object hovering over some trees. Returning the next day, they found strange burn marks in the trees. In 2004, a young man saw a glowing sphere appearing and disappearing over his home.</p>

<p>Nine new locations: each with a history of UFO encounters. These encounters are supported by multiple witnesses, landing traces, physiological effects, animal reactions, photographs and more. The huge number of cases make it undeniable that we are being visited.</p>

<p>The most extensive UFO encounter is being taken onboard an extraterrestrial craft. This is the cutting edge of UFO research. These cases  hold the potential to answer the many questions surrounding ET contact: who are these visitors to our planet, where do they come from, and why are they here? This video presents eight amazing cases involving people who have been taken onboard a UFO and met aliens face-to-face.</p>

<p>THE EARTH WILL ROLL: THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF MARION FRANCIS. At 12:30 pm on Feb 10, 1969, Marion Francis and her friend Jim Wells drove from Jacksonville, FL to Daytona Beach. It should’ve taken one a half hours, but weirdly it took five. Marion suffered from a bad headache, weakness and depression. Later, she went under hypnosis and recalled being taken onboard a craft. She was examined by a gray ET. They showed her where they came from, and said that Earth would one day tilt on its axis, and that the ETs would be there to rescue those who are not afraid to go.</p>

<p>DAZED AND CONFUSED IN A UFO: THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF JOSE PEREIRA SACRAMENTO. On the night of May 20, 1969, Jose Pereira Sacramento heard a noise outside his home in Vila Operaria, Brazil. Going to investigate, he was shocked to see a UFO landing in his backyard. He was suddenly pulled inside it where he met short beings standing in weird cylinders, speaking an unknown language. He was frozen in place as the room filled with painfully bright light. Suddenly he found himself back in bed. His eyes were badly inflamed, and he suffered from lightheadedness for a full year.</p>

<p>TRANSFORMED BY THE ETS: THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF JOSEPH SUSEDIK. On May 26, 1974, while camping at Mitchell Caverns in California, Joseph and his family saw a UFO. That night, he was woken up by colored lights outside the trailer and found himself immobilized. Upon awakening, he had vague memories of being taken somewhere. Later under hypnosis, he recalled an onboard UFO encounter where ETs showed him the inside of the craft, images of Saturn and various nebulae. Following this, Joseph became a prolific inventor, and he and his wife pioneered the field of prenatal learning.</p>

<p>PROBED BY ALIENS: THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF JANET STEWART. While driving to a friend’s house in Bethel, Minnesota on the night of Jan 6, 1976, Janet was shocked when a UFO paced her car. Picking up her friend, she also saw the UFO. Arriving home, Janet was missing an hour of time, and had sore eyes. Under hypnosis, she recalled she had been stopped by the UFO, and taken onboard. She was physically examined and returned to her car. The encounter made, her a more easy-going, open-minded and tolerant person.</p>

<p>THERE ARE THINGS I STILL CANNOT TELL: THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF NESTOR URRUTI. On the morning of May 14, 1976, Nestor Urruti was driving through Olivarria, Argentina when a UFO pulled him onboard with his truck. He found himself sitting in front of a horseshoe-shaped panel with odd symbols. A telepathic voice told him that one day the ETs will reveal themselves to the world. He then found himself back in his truck. He was badly traumatized and had to be hospitalized.</p>

<p>YOU WILL BEGIN TO SEE THINGS: THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF DOROTHY Y. On Sept 15, 1976, Dorothy was awakened by bright lights outside her home in New London, MO. Going outside, she saw short strange beings. Suddenly, she was in bed and it was the next morning. Later under hypnosis, she was taken onboard and recalled being physically examined. The ETs told her that she would being to see things: a prediction which turned out to be true when she began having psychic visions of disasters.</p>

<p>A JOURNEY ONBOARD A UFO: THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF VICTOR AND BORIS. In Jul 1986, while hiking in the woods outside of Shenkursk, Russia, Victor and Boris, came upon a strange craft and two human-looking men in jumpsuits. The men invited Victor and Boris onboard. So began an amazing journey where the two witnesses were flown across Europe. They asked many questions of the strange men. At one point, one of the ETs allowed Victor to pilot the craft. They were then returned back to the forest, amazed by their encounter.</p>

<p>A FIGHT WITH STRANGE HUMANOIDS: THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF ROLF FULLER. On July 25, 1992, Rolf was amazed to see a UFO outside his family’s home in Tuttlingen, Germany. That night, he woke up to find himself inside a UFO, confronted by short ETs with large eyes. Rolf fought with the ETs. Suddenly, he was knocked unconscious. He woke up back in bed and to his shock, the humanoids were still there!</p>

<p>Eight onboard cases, each with details which are remarkably similar and confirm each other’s accounts, and each with unique details that show how much we still have to learn. What these cases do show is that people all over the world are being taken onboard extraterrestrial craft and meeting extraterrestrials face-to-face. It has been happening for a long time.</p>

<p>A teacher from Virginia, Sondra came from a military family and has lived in many locations on the planet. She was born in 1940, and like many ET contactees, unusual events surrounded her from a very young age. In fact, when she was only a few weeks old, her mother woke up one morning to see Sondra levitating above her crib! Soon other mystical events occurred. At age three, while living in sunny Long Beach in southern California, Sondra discovered that she was able to call forth the wind, and even make it snow.</p>

<p>In 1946, Sondra’s father (now an  attaché to a Navy Admiral) moved the family to Tsingtao, China where they lived in the former Swiss Embassy building. There Sondra soon displayed other abilities. She began having out-of-body experiences. Fresh-cut flowers would remain alive and healthy in her room for weeks on end. She began to hear a voice in her head teaching her about the human body. She excelled academically to a degree that should would soon skip grades in school, and more. Her stay in China was cut short by conflict within the country, and in 1947, her father was called to serve in Albuquerque, New Mexico. It was there that Sondra had perhaps the most unusual event of her life.</p>
<p>Sondra had just turned eight-year-old and one day, with her parents’ permission, she decided to ride her bicycle to a friend’s home one mile away. This was something she had done many times, but on this occasion, she never made it there. When she did not arrive, her family began a 7-hours-long frantic search for Sondra, finally finding her dazed and in a trance alongside the remote highway near her home, in an area where they had already searched several times. They asked her what happened, but Sondra did not dare tell them. She knew they would never believe her.</p>
<p>As she biked down the desolate highway, a shadow appeared overhead, and looking up, she saw a metallic craft hover overhead. It quickly landed on the road in front of her. Sondra stopped and watched as an opening appearing in the craft, and standing in the doorway was a tall humanoid praying mantis beckoning her inside the craft. More curious than afraid, Sondra approached. That mantis being told Sondra to have no fear, that she was her mother and invited her onboard the craft. Fascinated, Sondra accepted the offer.</p>
<p>Entering the craft, she was shocked to see that it was much larger on the inside than the outside. Immediately a half-dozen short little figures crowded around her, playfully touching her blond hair and escorting her around the craft. She first thought they were little children, but saw that they had large bald heads, big dark eyes, and gray skin. Sondra explored the craft which was very sparse. Looking out a porthole, she was shocked to see the Earth off in the distance. The mantis being led her to the center of the room where there was a holographic device displaying full-color, three-dimensional images. Sondra was shocked and saddened to see images of soldiers, tanks, explosions and more.  The mantis said, “What you are seeing are pictures of future wars,” and told Sondra that it was her duty to warn others about this.</p>
<p>After a few more messages, Sondra suddenly found herself back in her home with her concerned parents. Sondra later told her grandmother who shared that she also had encounters as a little girl, but otherwise learned to keep her experience a secret.</p>
<p>Sondra grew up, got a few college degrees, fell in love, got married and had children. She continued to have OBEs and other unusual events. Then one day her husband said he had seen grays at the foot of the bed speaking to Sondra. She had no memory of this, but shortly later, she began having repeated visitations by the grays in her bedroom, who would hold long conversations with her. The visits occurred for many years. Only a few times did Sondra ever see them arrive or leave. She rarely remembered the content of the conversations.</p>
<p>Eventually the visits slowed and one day stopped. One of her final visits occurred in 2018. The grays had come to again give her in urgent warning about future wars on our planet, and advise her to move out of the city and into the mountains, a warning which she and her husband heeded. Today, she lives there peacefully. Sondra agreed to share her story as she feels its important to communicate the warnings given to her by the ETs. If you are interested in hearing more about Sondra’s amazing encounter, her story (and many others) is presented in my book, “Humanoids and High Strangeness: Twenty True UFO Encounters.” Now available!</p>

<p>There is nothing quite like a face-to-face encounter with a humanoid creature. An experience like this almost always has a profound effect on the witness, challenging them mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. It is something they remember for the rest of their lives. Encounters like these are far more common than you might think, and involve a mind-boggling variation of humanoid types. Here are ten little-known cases coming from across the planet, each involving different humanoid creatures, from tiny beings less than a foot tall, to creatures upwards of twelve feet in height. Several involve multiple witnesses, not to mention landing traces, electromagnetic disturbances, animal reactions and medical effects.</p>

<p>A SIX-INCH HUMANOID. On April 20, 1945, an anonymous priest was picking edible mushrooms in the forest near Reneve, France when he saw a 6-inch-tall little man wearing a full-body jumpsuit and carrying a little rod strapped to his back. The stunned priest wanted to capture the little man, but it quickly ran off into the bushes.</p>

<p>I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. One day in Spring of 1957, two 9-year-old boys were playing in a field near their homes in Taboada, Spain when movement caught their eye. Looking up, they saw a row of helmeted humanoids walking through the wall of house and up into the air where they promptly disappeared.</p>

<p>AN ALIEN AT THE FRONT DOOR. On the night of August 31, 1968, a lady heard a loud knock on the front door of her home in Bahia Blanca, Argentina. Opening the curtain, she saw a strange man, nearly 7 feet tall with a bald head, no ears, and glowing eyes, wearing a shiny black jumpsuit. She was paralyzed in fear as the man moved off, laughing.</p>

<p>ETS INVESTIGATE FARMHOUSE. On February 6, 1969, Jose Antonio Fioco was working at a farm in Pirassununga, Brazil when a UFO landed on the property. Three humanoids appeared, one sending down a beam of light on the chicken coop. This was just the first of many encounters in the area, including another landing witnessed by a crowd of people.</p>

<p>TWO HUMAN-LIKE FIGURES. One night in January 1974, a father and son were woken up when their home in Pjedsted, Denmark filled with light. Looking outside, they saw a saucer-shaped craft and two humanoids looking straight down at them. So began a 5-minute-long staring contest which ended only as the craft moved away.</p>

<p>THE ALIEN IN THE FOREST. Going into woods to train his dog around midnight on January 4, 1977, an auto-worker from Carapito, Portugal came upon a large saucer-shaped craft with a humanoid standing below it. After a few moments, the craft and humanoid disappeared, but researchers later found landing traces at the site.</p>

<p>THE GIANT GLOWING FIGURE. At 10pm on night in November 1977, John and Gail Weldon drove along a rural road in the Megalong Valley in NSW, Australia when a gigantic glowing figure upwards of 12-feet in height strode towards their car. This is just one of several dramatic UFO incidents in this area.</p>

<p>WHAT BEAUTIFUL EYES. One night in May 1991, KT, a lady living in an apartment in the small town of Istok, Russia kept hearing strange footsteps. Finally she was confronted by a gray-type ET with huge dark beautiful eyes. Later, investigators learned that other people in the building reported strange events, including seeing a UFO that very night.</p>

<p>TWO VERY STRANGE HUMANOIDS. One night in Winter 1994, two young men were riding a motorbike on a rural road outside Musei, Italy when they came upon a 1-foot-tall humanoid with large eyes and pointing ears crossing the road in front of them. Years earlier, the witness and his family had an even more frightening encounter with a winged humanoid.</p>

<p>EYES LIKE A FLY. Hearing a strange beeping noise late on the night of May 10, 1995, a teenage boy exited the bedroom of his home in Columbia, Missouri and was terrified to see a 4-foot-tall gray alien staring at him through the living room glass door only three feet away.</p>

<p>THE ET IN THE RAIN. One night in October 1995, two 13-year-old girls were horseback riding through the woods near their homes in Breitbrunn, Germany. Without warning, they came upon a dome-shaped silver saucer covered with colored lights sitting on the ground, and next to it were little “munchkin-sized” humanoids.</p>

<p>CHARGED BY AN ALIEN. Around 7:30 pm one evening in July 2018, “Jacob” was playing in the yard of his grandparents' home in a rural and isolated area of Newaygo, Michigan. Movement behind a tree caught his eye. To his shock, a tall, skinny creature with a big bald head, large eyes and gray skin crawled out, stood up and stared, then suddenly charged right at him.</p>

<p>These twelve cases offer a brief glimpse into what it’s like to have a face-to-face unearthly encounter with strange humanoids. These cases show how scary and traumatic an encounter can be, and make it clear that we still have a lot to learn about who is walking among us on this planet.</p>

TWELVE TRUE CASES</a>.</h3>

<p>It’s the coldest, windiest, driest, highest and most remote place on Earth. Its average temperature is 50-70 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. It has no permanent residents. It contains up to 90 percent of the world’s freshwater. It covers 5.5 million square miles, about 98 percent of which is covered with ice. This is, of course, Antarctica. Nobody owns it. The 1951 Antarctic treaty outlawed ownership, and limits its use to peaceful, scientific research. Each year, 1000-5000 scientists and military officers are stationed at the various bases. About 40,000 tourists visit there yearly. As with the Arctic, conspiracies abound, from secret Nazi bases, to an entrance to the hollow Earth. True or not, what is undeniably true is that the Antarctic has a long and rich history of UFO encounters. This video presents twelve cases of UFOs in Antarctica. They reach back 75 years and include sightings, landings, and humanoids. A few represent some of the best-verified UFO encounters in the history of ufology.</p>

<p>WE HAVE PHOTOGRAPHS TO PROVE WHAT WE SAW. While at the Chilean base, Arturo Prat, on February 23, 1948 Captain Augusto Vars Orrego of the Chilean Navy says that “During the bright Antarctic night, we saw flying saucers, one above the other, turning at tremendous speeds. We have photographs to prove what we saw.” Sadly, the photos were never released.</p>

<p>THE COLD SCRUTINY OF UNKNOWN EYES. On January 8, 1956. Four Chilean scientists stationed at Robertson Island in the Weddell Sea saw two metallic cigar-shaped objects hovering in a vertical position overhead. Thus began an hours-long encounter during which their Geiger counter went off. They took many photographs, but again, the photos have never been released.</p>

<p>I’M ASHAMED TO SAY I PANICKED. On December 11, 1958, McMurdo Sound Base, AQI Roger Benson was driving a snow-tractor outside the base when he came upon a landed UFO and a strange humanoid. He drove away in fear. At that time, a wave of sightings swept the area, many of which were caught on radar. Rear Admiral Dufek, then in charge of the base said, “I believe in UFOs.”</p>

<p>A POLISHED GOLD SURFACE. On June 7, 1962, Navy scientists at Hallett Station saw a brilliant golden disc in the sky. They were able to use binoculars to discern the disc-shape of a solid object. Despite this, Project Blue Book labeled the case as the sighting of Jupiter.</p>

<p>UFO INVESTIGATES NUCLEAR TEST. On July 9, 1962, the US detonated a 1.45 megaton in space 250 miles over Johnson Atoll, blowing out Earth’s magnetic field for 30 seconds, knocking out several satellites, and damaging the electric grid. Following the explosion, an expedition in Antarctica viewed a massive UFO heading to the area of the explosion.</p>

<p>UFOs TAKE CONTROL OF AIRCRAFT. On April 20, 1964, a C-130 flight near McMurdo Station lost power. Nine UFOs showed up and held the plane aloft for many miles. The crew took 9 rolls of film. The strangest part of the encounter happened when the plane landed and the crew unloaded the equipment, which weighed far less than it should.</p>

<p>UFO WAVE OVER DECEPTION ISLAND. In June and July of 1965, a wave of UFO sightings swept over the military and scientific bases stationed on Deception Island. With hundreds of observations by trained observers, recorded with a variety of scientific instrumentation, including photos, the wave represents undeniable evidence of UFO reality.</p>

<p>THE BUZZING CLOUD. On May 22, 1966, a British survey team at Mount Gaudry observed a strange cloud-like object sending a beam down to the ground, and moving in ways that ruled out conventional aircraft or natural phenomenon.</p>

<p>UFO OVER VOLCANIC ERUPTION. On December 4, 1967, a volcanic eruption at Mount Deception forced an emergency evacuation and destroyed both the British and Chilean stations located there. Incredibly, a photo captured not only the disaster, but what appears to be a UFO.</p>

<p>ANTARCTICA UFO CRASH. Reports of UFO crashes abound and there is at least one in Antarctica. Although not well-verified, reportedly in October 1982 when an expedition searching for meteorites allegedly came upon a crashed craft and five ET bodies.</p>

<p>THEY’RE DOING THE STRANGEST THING. Per Linda Moulton Howe, in 1983 (date approx.) “Brian,” claims that while based at McMurdo he was on a flight over the Transantarctic Mountains when they encountered a group of UFOs on maneuvers, one of several strange events he experienced.</p>

<p>AN ENORMOUS CIRCLE OF LIGHT. In April 1991, scientists at the Argentinian General San Martin Base received anomalous readings on their scientific instrumentation indicating the presence of a large power source overhead. Hours later, one of the men made a visual observation of a massive object.</p>

<p>With so many encounters, observed by so many trained scientists, verified by such a wide variety of scientific instruments and photographed, there is only one possible conclusion: the Antarctic is being visited by UFOs.</p>

<p>The Arctic has always been a place of mystery and wonder. The magical Northern Lights, 
a rich wildlife of polar bears, seals, foxes and more, surviving in one of the most 
inhospitable locations on our planet, continue to capture our imagination. Speculation 
and conspiracies about the Arctic abound. But what is the truth? Have UFOs been seen 
there? The answer of course is yes! The Arctic Circle is 9,900 miles in circumference. 
Only 8 countries are located within this area, and yet it encompasses about 7.7 million 
miles. It also has a rich, varied history of UFO encounters reaching back to 1850 
continuing up to the current day. This video presents 25 of the best-verified and most 
fascinating accounts from the Arctic Circle.  These cases involve sightings, landings, 
humanoids and even an apparent UFO crash!</p>

<p>TWO UNKNOWN OBJECTS. In 1850, the crew of a ship sailing the Wellington Channel 
observed a mysterious glowing object.</p>

<p>AN EERIE EVENT. In 1912, the Russian Ship, Saint Anna became icebound in the Arctic 
for two years. On November 8, 1913, they had a remarkable sighting of a red glowing 
object.</p>

<p>ESKIMO VILLAGE DISAPPEARS. In 1930, trapper Joe Labelle went to Lake Angikuni, Canada 
to trade with the local village, only to find that everyone was gone. But where did they 
go?</p>

extensive encounter with weird glowing objects.</p>

<p>PROJECT PTARMIGAN. Researcher Lt. Col. Wendelle Stevens reveals that during his work 
in Alaska with Project Ptarmigan, many officers had incredible encounters with UFOs.</p>

<p>“IT WAS OBSERVED BY THE ENTIRE POPULATION.” In August 1950, resident of an arctic 
village and Russian aviators observe glowing discs in the sky for three days in a row.</p>

<p>THE SPITSBERGEN ISLAND UFO CRASH. In May 1952, a disc with UFO occupants allegedly 
crashed on the remote Spitsbergen Island.</p>

<p>UFO TRACKED ON THEODOLITE. On June 26, 1952, weather observers on Padloping Island 
track a UFO for five minutes.</p>

<p>“YOU’RE NOT GOING TO BELIEVE IT.” On April 29, 1952, navy pilots at Thule, Greenland 
observe three UFOs investigating a skyhook weather balloon.</p>

<p>A STRANGE OBJECT. In February 1953, the crew and passengers of a WV-2 Super 
Constellation observe a UFO over Thule, Greenland.</p>

<p>THIRD THULE SIGHTING. On December 9, 1953, three Navy flights over Thule, Greenland 
observe a strange craft near their jets.</p>

<p>UNIDENTIFIED. On August 29, 1954, the crew and passengers of a Dutch Airlines DC-4 see 
a fleet of dark objects near Prince Christian, Greenland.</p>

<p>SOMETHING SUPERNATURAL. In 1956, two Russian pilots of a TU-4 aircraft have an 
extensive sighting of a pearly disc-shaped object pacing their plane.</p>

<p>EXTREME ALTITUDE ARCTIC OBJECT. In November 1958, a US radar station detects an 
object hovering above the Arctic Circle.</p>

<p>A DISC LANDS AT UMIAT. In 1958-1959 a wave of sightings in the Arctic Circle caused 
concern within Finland and the Soviet Union. One case involved a landing at Umiat, 
Alaska.</p>

<p>NOTHING ON EARTH. On March 16, 1961, the crew of the USS Glacier observed “strange 
luminous aerial phenomenon.”</p>

<p>A PEARL-COLORED DISC. In February 1967, pilots over Tiksi, Siberia saw a pearl-
colored disc-shaped craft overtake their plane.</p>

<p>DISCONCERTINGLY CAPTIVATING, DEEPLY PROVOCATIVE, UTTERLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE. On August 
22, 1967, Soviet journalist Alfred Tulchensky had a closeup sighting of a metallic disc 
over the Taymyr Peninsula in Siberia.</p>

<p>AN EXTRAORDINARY THING HAPPENED TO ME ON MY WAY TO THE NORTH POLE. On March 1, 1968, 
while flying over the Arctic Circle, reporter Sally Remaley and others saw a group of 
six craft landed on the frozen tundra.</p>

<p>ESKIMOS OBSERVE UFO LANDING. On August 16-17, 1972 a wave of sightings occurred over 
St. Michael, Alaska, including a UFO landing.</p>

<p>ARCTIC OCEAN UFO. On October 16, 1976, the crew of a small boat in the Arctic Sea had

disc-shaped craft which disabled his aircraft.</p>

<p>CAUGHT ON RADAR. On January 5, 1981, observers at Thule Air Base in Greenland observed 
a UFO which is also caught on radar.</p>

<p>ARCTIC HUMANOID. In 1982 (approx.,) two men at an airbase in Greenland saw a humanoid. 
One was taken onboard a craft and given a vital message for all humanity.</p>

<p>WE ALL GOT REAL QUIET. On February 22, 1997, four people in Aklavic, Canada are paced 
in their car by two metallic craft.</p>

<p>WE’RE USED TO IT. For two weeks in December 2002, UFOs appeared so regularly over 
Noorvik, Alaska that residents saw them nightly.</p>

<p>These 25 cases are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to UFOs seen within the 
Arctic Circle. Cases likely number in the thousands. Because the Arctic is so remote and 
uninhabited, most activity likely goes unobserved by human eyes.</p>

<p>There are now enough cases to prove that UFOs and ETs are visiting the Arctic.</p>

<p>Healing is a major part of the extraterrestrial agenda. There are more than 300 cases 
coming from major researchers across the world including Budd Hopkins, David Jacobs, John 
Mack, Barbara Lamb, Edith Fiore, Timothy Good, Brad Steiger and more. People are being 
cured of a wide variety of injuries, illnesses, and conditions. Accounts reach back more 
than 100 years up to the present day. They can happen to anyone, anywhere, anytime. Most 
cases occur onboard UFOs or in a person’s home, but a small portion of cases occur in a 
place you would never expect: inside a hospital. It may sound incredible, but almost ten 
percent of UFO healing cases fit this category. This video presents 17 cases of this kind, 
which are only a small portion of the actual number of cases.</p>

<p>MY SIGHT RESTORED. April 1945, Okinawa Island. After being struck by shrapnel in his 
eye and suffering an eye infection that rendered him blind, Howard Menger is visited in 
his hospital tent and healed.</p>

<p>EYES FILLED WITH GREAT COMPASSION. June 1946, Camp Lee, VA. Allan Edwards is visited 
by a beautiful and unusual-looking man who he believes healed a patient of severe assault 
injuries.</p>

<p>YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO LOSE THAT FINGER. 1960s, NJ. After losing his hearing in a sled 
accident, Richard Rylka is healed in his hospital room by human-looking ETs. Later, 
after crushing his finger in an industrial accident, the ETs visit him again in the 
hospital.</p>

<p>WE’VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. May 1962, Durham, England. After being diagnosed 
with a hole in his lung, Fred White is visited by a human-looking ET who heals him with 
a strange instrument.</p>

<p>THE MIRACLE PATIENT. 1967, Lima, Peru. In 1967, Ludwig Pallman is visited in his room 
in the Maison Hospital by a human-looking female ET who cures him of kidney problems.</p>

<p>“THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE.” 1971, Laguna, CA. Burned on his neck and chest, Dr. Fred Bell 
is healed in his hospital room with the help of an artifact given to him by human-
looking ETs.</p>

<p>MY DOCTOR WAS AMAZED. November 1981, Hubbard, OR. After an emergency C-section, Denise 
Twiggs is visited by an ET who speeds up the healing of her caesarean scar.</p>

<p>A SOLUTION TO MY PROBLEM. Summer 1982, Willamette, Oregon. Suffering from a strep 
infection which has spread through his body, “Douglas” is healed by an ET using a 
strange silver instrument.</p>

<p>TOTALLY RECUPERATED. Summer 1989, Kiev, Ukraine. Lying in his hospital room after a 
stroke, Sergey K is visited by a human-looking figure who heals him by waving his hand 
over his body.</p>

<p>GET UP AND GO! April 18, 1989, Krasnoperekopsk, Ukraine. At the end stages of heart 
disease, Liudmila Petrovna is brought back to full health by a glowing man who appears 
in her hospital room.</p>

<p>I WAS SAVED. 1990s. Location unknown. When doctors were unable to heal her of 
pneumonia, Joni Ferris is abducted from her hospital room and cured by ETs.</p>

MIRACLE LEGS. November 1995, Sacramento, CA. After doctors told Connie Isele that they 
would have to amputate her leg, she is visited by ETs who cure her!</p>

<p>COMPLETELY HEALED. 2002. Italy. A man suffering from cancer is healed by three 
humanoid figures in glowing jumpsuits. The event is allegedly caught on video in his 
hospital room.</p>

<p>THEY CURED ME. 2005, Miami, FL. While being prepared for emergency surgery to remove 
a cancerous tumor in his lungs, Alberto Fernandez is suddenly healed by his ET friends.</p>

<p>THEY LOOKED LIKE PRAYING MANTIS. 2008, Canada. A woman visits her friend (suffering 
from a head injury) is amazed to see two praying mantis humanoids trying to heal her 
friend.</p>

<p>A SHINING GOLDEN LIGHT. February 2009, Andorra, Spain. Doctors report that at least 
four children are visited by ETs in their hospital rooms, curing them of terminal cancer.</p>

<p>TAUGHT BY THE ETS. Professor Bochereshoni, a mental health doctor from Tbilisi, 
Georgia, says he is visited by ETs in the hospital who assist him in diagnosing and 
curing patients suffering from mental illness.</p>

<p>Cases like these may sound incredible, but there are far too many to explain away 
as hoaxes, hallucinations, misperceptions, or mental illness. The miraculous recoveries 
verified by doctors and researchers speak for themselves. The UFO healing cases provide 
compelling evidence for extraterrestrial intervention. With 300 documented cases, it’s 
undeniable that ETs are on a healing mission across our planet. To explore these cases 
in more detail (and many others) check out my book, “The Healing Power of UFOs,” now 
available!</p>

<p>For many people, a humanoid encounter is one of the most shocking and incredible experiences of their lives. When someone experiences something that is completely foreign to their worldview, it can be incredibly difficult to understand and process. An encounter can be so shocking that it becomes almost impossible to speak about it. This video presents ten very close encounters with humanoids, several of which only became investigated through fortuitous circumstances. Many of these involve multiple witnesses and a wide variety of physical evidence such as landing traces, animal reactions, medical effects, electromagnetic disturbances and more.</p>

<p>THE UFO NEXT DOOR. On the night of May 5, 1952, Ann L Sohn (a nurse) looked out the window of her home in Prospect Park, Illinois and saw a massive, saucer-shaped craft. Through the portholes, Ann saw humanoids looking down at her. After a few moments, the craft darted away. Later, Ann learned that other people in the area saw UFOs on that same night. And the plants where the craft had hovered died.</p>

<p>A FEELING OF BEING WATCHED. On the night of December 9, 1960, Madame Dhelens looked out the window of her home in Carignan, France and saw an oval-shaped craft landed in the yard. Inside, she saw movement through a few portholes. It quickly rose up and darted away. Unknown to her, several people in the area also saw it. The next day, a circle of yellowed grass was found where the craft had landed.</p>

<p>THE MOST UNFORGETTABLE EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE. On the night of March 20, 1967, Jim Rible and his daughter Jean decided to take a drive to investigate weird lights in the sky that Jim’s wife had seen near their home in Butler, Pennsylvania. They saw the lights, but then the lights zoomed at them. Jean heard voices speaking to her mentally. Then five beings appeared in front of their car. It scared them so bad, they fled the scene.</p>
 
<p>THE MAN ON THE FLYING BOX. At 5:30 pm one night in November 1974, Giovanna Sensoli was at her farm in Case di Mordano, Italy when her animals acted crazily. Looking up, she saw a man in a jumpsuit straddling a floating box-shaped craft and looking down at her. A short distance away a brilliant object hung in the sky. Giovanna watched in amazement as it moved off and seemed to land in a nearby cemetery.</p>

<p>A ROBOTIC BEING. At 1:30 am in mid-September 1977, Luis Almeida was watering the garden behind his home in Gondomar, Portugal when a bright light shone on him from behind the brick wall bordering his property. Looking up, he was shocked to see that the light was coming from a gray, metallic, robot-looking figure at least 6 feet tall. Terrified, he ran inside, and was so traumatized, he couldn’t talk about it.</p>

<p>THE DAY THE ETS CAME TO VISIT. It was the night of November 2, 1977 as 16-year-old LC watched TV in his aunt’s house in Joaquin Murtinho, Brazil. Suddenly a metallic orb entered his home. A tall man dressed in a jumpsuit and two other figures appeared. Going outside, he saw a craft in the backyard. The ETs spoke to him telepathically, gave him predictions, then entered their craft and departed.</p>

<p>THE ALIEN AND THE FISHERMEN. On the night of February 4, 1978, six men fishing on Lake La Florida in San Luis, Argentina got the shock of their life when a saucer appeared overhead and released a tall, fair-haired, human-looking man dressed in a silver suit and transparent helmet. The man walked up to them, smiled, made a gesture of friendship, and left. The being left footprints in the ground, and others saw the UFO.</p>

<p>THE SINGING EXTRATERRESTRIALS. On February 1982, two men were in the area of Borok, Russia to take photos of monuments when they came upon a landed craft. Two humanoids in jumpsuits emerged. One of the men became entranced and immobilized, but the other remained awake as the beings approached and communicated to him with harmonic tones. They left after a few minutes, but the witness’s life was changed forever.</p>

<p>IT WAS STRANGE. One night in August of 1983, four 12-year-old boys were playing in the woods outside their homes in Opole, Poland. Suddenly a thick fog appeared. Moments later, a craft landed right in front of them. They saw two humanoids exit and run by them into the forest. They gave chase but the ETs eluded them. The craft took off leaving behind undeniable landing traces.</p>

<p>“HUMANS DON’T KNOW WHAT THEY HAVE.” On March 26, 2002, an anonymous salesman was driving outside Cazalla de la Sierra, Spain when a pear-shaped craft blocked the road ahead. Looking into the field, he saw two very tall humanoids in jumpsuits. He exited his car and spoke with one of the beings who was very friendly and told him that Earth was a very beautiful place.</p>

<p>These ten cases are just a small portion of the actual number of cases, and yet they each provide amazing insights about ET contact. There are now enough documented cases to conclude that we are being visited by extraterrestrials.</p>

<p>UFOs are being seen all over this planet. To prove this fact, I put out a challenge: name any town or city, and I will find an encounter there. And I have! I have explored almost 100 towns and cities and every one of them has a history of UFO encounters. Not just sightings, but landings, face-to-face meetings with humanoids, onboard encounters and even UFO crashes. In this latest episode, we explore eight new places including, Albion, MI; Austin, TX; Leesville, LA; Whittier, CA; Huntsville, AL; Elkton, MD; Seoul, South Korea and finally, Oshkosh, WI. These cases reach back decades and have lots of evidence: photos, radar-returns, landing traces, animal reactions, medical effects, and even metal fragments. We are not alone!</p>

<p>ALBION, MICHIGAN. In 1967, Charles W. Smith encountered a UFO which told him telepathically to talk to his priest. Two sightings later, Charles told his priest who turned out to have a close UFO connection himself. Later, Charles encountered a landed UFO with humanoids. In 1973, numerous police in Albion reported UFOs. In 1980, the Shive family described their harrowing encounter with a UFO that stalled their van on a lonely road at night. Even as late as 2007 UFOs continued to visit Albion.</p>

<p>AUSTIN, TEXAS. This large city has a rich UFO history. In 1950, three men saw a craft hover over downtown. In 1971, a craft landed in a lady’s front-yard and out stepped three humanoids. In 1974, Ray Stanford and his team captured an amazing long-exposure photo. In 1977, Ray had his own daylight sighting. In 1988, three men came upon a landed disc and humanoids; they all had missing time. More incredible encounters occurred throughout the 2000s, including UFOs captured on videotape.

<p>LEESVILLE, LOUISIANA. On April 12, 1960, a UFO was seen and heard by dozens of people as it moved overhead and exploded into the ground before flying off. It left behind landing traces and metal fragments. Project Blue Book wrote an 80-page report on the case which remains unsolved. In 1975, a mother and her son had a very close-up encounter with a disc-shaped craft. In 1996, UFOs over the town generated numerous calls to radio stations and newspapers reporting strange lights over the town.</p>

<p>WHITTIER, CALIFORNIA. In 1957, people across Whittier saw up to six saucer-shaped craft hovering and maneuvering overhead. In 1966, a car was chased for many miles by a craft. In 1967, two men had a close-up sighting of a metallic craft with portholes hovering over their front yard. On the night of March 23, 1977 when dozens of police and military officers sighted UFOs over a wide area for nine hours! In 1978, a lady saw a craft over the freeway.</p>

<p>HUNTSVILLE, ALABAMA. In 1950, two men saw a metallic craft over the city. Two sightings occurred in 1952, both with many witnesses. In 1975, a man followed a UFO in his car into the woods and had two hours of missing time. In 1981, a woman had had an onboard experience involving a strange humanoid. That same year, another man reported his encounter with a giant craft. In 1988, a craft rose out of Gunterville Lake. It followed them home. In 2023, a witness captured photo of UFOs over the city.</p>

<p>ELKTON, MARYLAND. In 1971, a family and other witnesses encountered two UFOs while driving into Elkton. In 1988, a family driving into Elkton were followed by a UFO and had three hours of missing time. In 1993, two boaters on the Elk River had a bizarre encounter with a USO. That same year, a man had a scary encounter that resulted in hours of missing time. In 1994, a witness had a scary encounter with a saucer hovering over a field. And in 2012, an Elkton man reported a missing time encounter.</p>

<p>SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA. So many cases! In 1970, seven military officers and many residents saw a silver disc move overhead. In 1951, fighter pilots observed green spheres which were also caught on radar. Sightings occurred throughout the 1950s, some of which were also caught on radar. In 1979, a soldier stationed at Kunsan Airbase says a humanoid entered his barracks. In 1981 and 1982 there were two sightings of a cone-shaped UFO.  From 1995-2012, three cases occurred, all involving photos!</p>

<p>OSHKOSH, WISCONSIN. Way back in 1886, at midday, a darkness settled over Oshkosh causing a city-wide panic. In 1947, three witnesses came upon a hovering craft with humanoids looking out the window. In 1956, a group of children had two sightings of UFOs on one day. In 1979, many people called the police reporting a red UFO which apparently crashed into the ground. In 2012, people over a wide area reported strange lights in the sky. In 2022, a UFO was captured on photograph over the suburbs.</p>

<p>So many cases involving close encounters of the first, second and third kind. Too many cases to deny or explain away. The only alternative is that these cases are true; we are being visited by extraterrestrials. It doesn’t matter where you live on Earth, UFOs have been there!</p>

<p>People across the world are reporting direct contact with UFOs and extraterrestrials. 
Cases reach back more than 100 years and number in the many thousands, or as some 
researcher believe, in the millions. Researchers have discovered that contact is often 
generational, following certain family lines. As a general rule, it begins in early 
childhood and continues throughout a person’s life. This video presents the contact 
experiences of Mike W, a retired apartment manager originally from Norman, Oklahoma. 
His encounters include events that are both typical and commonly reported, as well as 
unique elements of extreme high strangeness.</p>

<p>Born in 1945, Mike’s experiences began in the early 1950s. Around age five, Mike 
would periodically and inexplicably disappear from his home. His parents and family 
would search for him, and find him sometimes miles from their home on a random street 
corner. Mike has no memories of these missing time encounters, but his parents assured 
him that it happened many times. Around that time, his parents extracted what appeared 
to be a strange, tiny, ceramic rod from his arm. In hindsight, Mike wonders, could this 
have been an alien implant?</p>

<p>Years passed with no unusual experiences. Mike moved to Portland, Oregon. And on May 
11, 1970, Mike (now 25 years old) had a series of three consecutive encounters on that 
day that would leave him baffled for the rest of his life. The first occurred while 
walking down the sidewalk in downtown Portland, near the local University where a 
series of anti-war protests had escalated to riots that would garner national headlines. 
Mike noticed two seven-foot-tall, identical-looking gentleman wearing dark suits walking 
towards him. They confronted him and told him, “We can take you anytime we feel like it.” 
A short conversation followed, and the men identified themselves as CIA agents. Mike 
didn’t believe them, but shocked and afraid, he turned and ran.</p>

<p>Later that night, he was walking down Jefferson Street when he saw a crowd of people 
watching a fight in front of a bar. Mike’s attention was drawn to two tall, identical-
looking gentlemen standing behind the crowd observing intently. The two men were seven 
feet tall, dressed identically in ankle-length brown robes and golden Nefertiti-like 
headwear. Also odd was that nobody seemed to notice them. Even stranger, they held 
their hands out in a peculiar way. Curious about their weird appearance and behavior, 
Mike stood next to them and asked them what they were doing. One of them replied that 
they were reading people’s minds to determine what was going on. Mike offered to 
investigate for them and almost ended up getting involved in the bar fight. When he 
turned around, the men were gone. Only then did he wonder, were they the same men who 
had confronted him earlier?</p>

<p>Walking back home, he had his third and strangest encounter. An attractive woman 
dressed in the same kind of ankle-length brown robe approached him and said, “I need to 
have sex with you.” It was an offer Mike couldn’t resist, and he took the woman home. 
Making love, he was shocked to find that the woman’s anatomy had some profoundly strange 
abnormalities. Her skin seemed rubbery. She began to communicate to him telepathically. 
And at one point, he looked at her and was shocked to see that she appeared to be bald. 
After being intimate, she left without a word and was gone. After thinking about it and 
the other two encounters, he began to wonder if all three encounters were connected, and 
were the people he had seen even human?</p>

<p>Years later, one night in 1988, Mike (now living in northern California) went up to 
the mountains overlooking the San Francisco Bay to play with his ham radio. Shortly after 
parking, he realized a brilliant light was shining down on him. Exiting his car, he 
turned and saw a gigantic craft hovering right above a hill a short distance away. It was 
not normal, and Mike stood there in awe. The next thing he knew, he had a lapse of 
consciousness and the craft was in a different place. It then disappeared in a flash. 
Mike forgot about the entire incident until he had a series of terrifying dreams of 
being taken inside a craft and examined by gray ETs. Recalling his sighting and missing 
time, he realized he had been abducted by aliens.</p>

<p>Following this encounter, weird things began to happen. He developed an interest and 
advanced knowledge of electronics. He exhibited psychic abilities that were so powerful, he 
vowed to never use them again. The encounter also changed his view of the world and his 
place in it. Eventually, he would have another UFO sighting that convinced him he was 
being watched by extraterrestrials.</p>

<p>Mike is just one of many people who are reporting UFO and extraterrestrial experiences. 
The complete story of his contacts is presented in my book, Humanoids and High Strangeness: 
Twenty True UFO Encounters , now available. LINK: https://amzn.to/3CaANiI.</p>

<p>For more than 100 years, people across the world have been taken onboard extraterrestrial craft. Many of the cases have commonalities that corroborate each other down to minute details. But they also have unique high strangeness aspects that have much to teach us. This video presents ten spectacular onboard UFO cases involving face-to-face interactions with a variety of ETs. Cases like these are the cutting edge of UFO research and have the potential to answer the many questions surrounding alien contact.</p>

<p>“I STARTED TO CRY.” THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF MR GB. One summer day of 1921, an 8-year-old boy was playing along the Canal Nord in Peronne, France when two tall, thin figures in metallic jumpsuits appeared, grabbed him, and took him into a strange craft. Inside he was placed on a flexible couch in a small room. Mr. GB cried and the ETs let him go, miles from where he had been taken.</p>

<p>“THE SOUL LIVES FOREVER” THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF EMILIA. One day in July 1942, Emilia was walking to her home in Niinisalo, Finland when a lady appeared and spoke to her telepathically. The lady brought Emilia to a flying saucer and invited her inside, showed Emilia how to fly the craft and spoke to her of spiritual subjects. After being released, she fell ill and had to be hospitalized.</p>

<p>“IF YOU DON’T BELIEVE IT, I CAN’T SAY I BLAME YOU.” THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF RICARDO MACHADO. Riding his motorbike near Pajas Blancas, Argentina one morning in April 1957, Ricardo Machado saw a disc-shaped craft ahead of him. He ditched his motorbike and hid. A man emerged from the craft, approached Ricardo, and took him onboard. Unknown to Ricardo, many people in the area were seeing UFOs.</p>

<p>“THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOVE US.” THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF MR. GREENAMYER. One summer day in 1958, three boys were playing outside their homes in Novato, California when a strange silver craft appeared overhead. Two of the boys fell asleep and one of the boys was shocked to see weird figures around them. The witness had vague memories of attacking them. Later under hypnosis, he recalled being taken onboard.</p>

<p>THEY CAME FROM THE STARS. THE ONBOARD ENCOUNTER OF MRS. D.S. While driving to her home in Sedalia, Missouri at 11pm on August 16, 1965, a young lady was shocked to see a strange figure and a weird light in a field. She drove off in fear and arrived home to find herself missing over an hour of time. Later under hypnosis, she recalled being taken onboard a craft where she was examined by ETs.</p>

<p>“I SAW THREE BEINGS.”  THE ONBOARD ENCOUNTER OF MRS. G. Hanging up her clothes in her backyard in Ermington, UK one day in October 1965, a woman saw a glowing blue light hover overhead. Suddenly three figures in jumpsuits appeared, grabbed her, and used a beam of light to lift her into the craft. She found herself in a small room, but quickly passed out. She woke up in her backyard as the craft zipped away.</p>

<p>TAKEN TO ANOTHER PLANET. THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF DIRCEU GOES. One night in June 1967, Dirceu Goes saw a glowing sphere in the sky near his home in Sarandi, Brazil. A beam of light came from the craft, carrying two short humanoids who grabbed Dirceu and pulled him onboard. He found himself in a tiny low-ceilinged room and remained there for 6 hours as the beings took him to what appeared to another world, then took him back to Earth.</p>

<p>THEY LOOKED LIKE INSECTS. THE ONBOARD UFO ENCOUNTER OF WENDEL AND NANCY. While driving one night in June 1969 near Salt Lake City, Utah, a couple was chased by a UFO. They pulled off at a rest-stop and saw a weird humanoid approaching. Later under hypnosis, both recalled being taken onboard, put in a weird chair, and examined by short ETs with blue eyes.</p>

<p>“THE FEELING I HAD WAS ONE OF UNDERSTANDING.” THE ONBOARD EXPERIENCE OF LUKE. While driving near Hillsboro, Kansas one night in November 1971, “Luke” was amazed to see a silver flying saucer hover over a nearby field. He stopped his car and approached. Two short, bald, human-looking ETs wearing robes invited him onboard and gave him a tour of the craft. Afterward Luke began having psychic experiences.</p>

<p>AN INSECTOID PRAYING MANTIS. THE ONBOARD EXPERIENCE OF JUNE. Driving to her home in West Palm Beach, Florida on the night of August 15, 1997, a woman was puzzled by a strange darkness descending over her car. She arrived home 30 minutes late. After having other weird encounters, she used hypnosis and recalled that she had been taken onboard a craft and examined by praying mantis type ETs.</p>

<p>Ten cases, each adding to the growing database of similar accounts. One case like this could be easily dismissed, or ten or even a hundred. But there are thousands of cases like these, and some researchers believe it might number in the millions. As hard as they are to believe, there are too many cases to explain away as hoaxes, hallucinations, misperceptions, or mental illness. Humanity is in contact with aliens!</p>

<p>The cutting edge of the UFO phenomenon are cases involving direct, firsthand, face-to-face contact with extraterrestrial humanoids. Unlike simple sightings, humanoid encounters allow us to closely interact with the UFO occupants themselves. Here are ten cases of extreme contact, cases of contact that are so close, so extensive, they cannot be denied or explained away. These are the kinds of cases that answer the many questions surrounding ET contact, such as who they are, where they come from and why they are here.</p>

<p>THE DISAPPOINTED ALIEN. On the night of October 18, 1954, Renzo Pugina returned home after a night at the movies. Walking up to his home in Parravicino, Italy, he was confronted by a four-foot-tall, olive-skinned entity wearing a jumpsuit and helmet. Afraid but curious, he approached the creature who struck him with a paralyzing beam of light. With great effort, Renzo broke free of the paralysis and chased the figure away.</p>
 
<p>THE MARTIAN STONE. Around midnight on November 17, 1954, Alberto Sanmartin Comes (a nurse) was taking a walk in Madrid, Spain, when he came upon a fair-skinned, angelic-looking man wearing a strange jumpsuit. The man walked up to a small craft landed nearby, quickly returned, and gaveAlberto a small stone covered with odd symbols. He then returned to his craft, which flew away. Alberto’s case generated national headlines as scientists analyzed the alien artifact.</p>

<p>THE ALIEN FROGMEN. One night in 1956, just after midnight, 13-year-old, Mr. E. Venebles woke up in his bedroom in Aveley, UK, as a brilliant light flooded his backyard. Looking out the window he saw a huge craft covered with colored lights. Through the portholes he saw several strange figures wearing “frogmen’s suits.” Then he saw a shadowy figure standing near his home. As he opened his window, the figure disappeared and the UFO flew off.</p>

<p>“I SAW A MAN.” On the morning of April 23, 1966, six-year-old Kim Baker was picking flowers outside her home in Bingham, Maine when a classic flying-saucer landed nearby. Kim was amazed to see a human-looking man smiling at her from one of the portholes. After a few moments, the craft took off. Kim rushed home and told her mother, who returned to the spot to find strange landing traces.</p>

<p>“A HUMAN-LIKE BEING WAS WATCHING ME.” On the night of March 25, 1972, Mr. B. of Soesterberg, the Netherlands was woken up by a strange noise. Looking outside, he saw a strange light by his car. He rushed outside and felt compelled to drive off into the night. Shortly later, he came upon a landed UFO and inside it, a human-like figure looking at him.</p>

<p>ALIENS IN IOWA. On June 6, 1972, Mr. Teig was working the cornfields of his farm in Dayton, Iowa when a silver egg-shaped craft landed nearby. Out stepped three short alien figures wearing metallic jumpsuits. Mr. Teig froze in amazement as the ETs explored his crops for the next 30 minutes then returned to their craft and departed. At that time, many farmers were finding strange burned circles in their fields.</p>

<p>A SENSATION OF BEING WATCHED. One night in April 1973, a man was driving near Grelsby, Finland when he came upon a huge flying saucer. He exited his car to take a closer look. He smelled a powerful order, and watched the craft move towards him. He could now see strange figures in the portholes. The craft moved away. Later, the area would later having many dramatic encounters.</p>

<p>“THIS DEEP SILENCE SURROUNDED US.” On the night of August 22, 1975, two young men drove their motorcycles near St Omer, France. Suddenly a bright light zoomed up behind them. They thought it was a car, but it disappeared, and moments later, they saw a landed UFO and humanoids next to the highway. An eerie silence fell reigned as the two humanoids rushed towards them. The men fled in a panic.</p>

<p>SHOCKED BY A UFO. On the night of October 12, 1977, Manoel Espirito Santo and four friends were outside his home in Santo Antonio do Taua, Brazil when a glowing light appeared, zoomed down and revealed itself to be a craft. Two figures stood inside looking down on the group. A beam of light flashed down and struck Manoel, immobilizing him. It then darted off. At the time, many people in the area were having similar encounters.</p>

<p>“WE HAVE BEEN WATCHING YOU.” In 1979, as a young child in Lima, Peru, Renato Longato woke up one evening to find a beautiful woman wearing a metallic jumpsuit approach his bedside and instruct him to learn how to “use his mind.” Renato decided to develop his psychic abilities, and years later, in 1985, had a face-to-face encounter with a handsome ET approached him with a special message just for him.</p>

<p>These ten firsthand cases of ET contact are just the tip of the iceberg. Thousands of cases like these are on record, reaching back decades and coming from across the world. There are too many cases to deny, too much evidence. The truth is evident: we are being visited by extraterrestrials.</p>

<p>Now introducing UFOs In Your Hometown: Episode Seven. This ongoing series began with a challenge: name any town or city, and I bet I can find a UFO case there. The response has been tremendous. More than 700 locations were received. And so far, I have found UFO cases in every town and city I have investigated. Sightings, landings, humanoids, and onboard experiences – all are represented. And supporting them is a wide variety of evidence: multiple eyewitness testimonies, photos and videos, landing traces, medical effects, animal reactions, electromagnetic disturbances and more. Today we explore seven new locations, supplied by you, the viewers. These locations include Folsom, California; Napier, New Zealand; Bountiful, Utah; Hickory, North Carolina; Evansville, Indiana and Kalispell, Montana. Have UFOs been seen in your hometown? The answer is almost certainly, yes!</p>

<p>FOLSOM, CALIFORNIA. On August 17, 1960, witnesses observed a UFO hover over the city for two hours. Throughout 1972, numerous witnesses observed UFO activity over Folsom Lake. This location would regularly produce more encounters over the years, including all the way up to 2016. A very dramatic sighting of a rare “daylight disc” occurred along Highway 50 when two women were buzzed in their car by a low flying craft.</p>

<p>NAPIER, NEW ZEALAND. An early Napier sighting occurred in 1952 when a trucker observed a fleet of six objects traveling in a row across the sky. In 1953, a group of boy-scouts described their encounter with a very strangely-shaped UFO. In 1955, more than 20 people driving through Napier pulled off the road to observe a brilliant green UFO. Two years later in 1957, multiple independent witnesses saw a UFO on the same day. Activity continued in 1961, 1967 and in 1968, when a low flying UFO resulted in a witness being taken to court for reckless driving. A sighting of a landed UFO in 1969 caught the attention of researchers as it involved strange landing traces. Major sightings continued, making it clear that Napier is of great interest to UFOs.</p>

<p>BOUNTIFUL, UTAH. Although this city is fairly large, it has produced only a few significant UFO cases. One occurred in 1969 when two young men observed two UFOs while attending a late-night movie at a drive-in theater. A sighting on October 10, 2019 of multiple objects received considerable attention from researchers as the witness was able to obtain videotape of strange lights over the city.</p>

<p>HICKORY, NORTH CAROLINA. In 1952, two independent witnesses both observed a classic saucer move at high speed over the city. In 1959, a witness reported being chased by a glowing blue object in his car outside of Hickory, while numerous people in town and outside of it called police to report UFOs. In 1978, five young ladies reported a UFO circling over the local college. More cases of UFOs chasing cars down Hickory Highways occurred in 1980 and 1983.

<p>MCKINNEY, TEXAS. In 1956, more than a hundred people, including the mayor of the city, reported a UFO which hovered over McKinney for six hours. In 2008, an entire family was driving to a soccer match and all observed a strange cigar-shaped craft. In 2018, a couple reported the landing of a UFO in the field behind their home. It turned out that they had prior sightings and perhaps deeper levels of contact.</p>

<p>EVANSVILLE, INDIANA. In 1953, a young boy saw a spherical-shaped craft with humanoids looking down at him through portholes. Police were called who reportedly opened fire on the object. One night in 1955, a group of students observed strange green-skinned humanoids run across the playing field of a local high school. Major sightings occurred in 1957, 1959 and in 1963 when three people were in their car when it was disabled by a low-flying craft. Sightings continued in 1968, 1970, 1973 and in 1974 when a famous news-anchor reported his sighting of a craft, and four people say they were abducted by a UFO. More sightings occurred regularly, in 1975, 1976, 1978 and onward, including a 2008 sighting of a craft that was so close, the witnesses called it the scariest moment of their lives.</p>

<p>KALISPELL, MONTANA. In 1956, a UFO hovered over the nearby mountains for so long that the Air Force scrambled six Starfire fighter jets to investigate. Through the 1970s, numerous people reported a wide variety of sightings over Kalispell, some who were so impressed by their sightings, they reported them to UFO centers. Evan as late as 2019, UFOs were being seen over Kalispell.</p>

<p>The cases speak for themselves. UFOs are ubiquitous. They are being seen everywhere on this planet. Name any location, and you can be sure that UFOs have been seen there. UFO encounters are far more common than most people think. In fact, the huge number of cases coming from all over the world show that the ETs are conducting a vigorous publicity campaign to announce their presence. They want us to know that we are not alone!</p>

<p>There are many different types of UFO encounters: sightings, landings, face-to-face encounters with humanoids and more. But the most extensive of all UFO encounters is an onboard experience, being taken onboard an extraterrestrial craft. Thousands of people accross the world have reported this experience. Cases reach back more than 100 years. They involve a wide variety of humanoids and have both striking similarities and unique differences. Here are seven firsthand accounts of people who claim to have been taken onboard an ET craft.</p>

<p>“PEACE BE WITH YOU”: THE ONBOARD ENCOUNTER OF JL BUICK. One day in July 1913, prospector J.L. Buick and a friend were explored the Badlands region of Montana when a “small brown man” approached and uttered the words, “Peace be with you, my friends.” Nearby sat a 100-foot-wide disc-shaped craft, surrounded by other small men. The man said that they had monitored Earth for more than a hundred years. After a short conversation, the ETs boarded the craft and departed. The craft returned the next day. J.L. Buick and his companion were invited onboard and given a tour of the craft. The ETs said they powered it with an “electromagnetic drive.” Afterwards, the men were returned to Earth.</p>

<p>“GOD IS ONLY ONE”: THE ONBOARD ENCOUNTER OF MARIO RESTIER. On December 4, 1949, Mario Restier was driving near Volta Redonda in Brazil when a 50-foot-wide craft landed nearby. A telepathic voice said, “Don’t be afraid. Do you want to know what it is?” Mario approached and met two humanoids who invited him onboard and, he says, took him to their planet in the Orion system and given a tour of their city. He held a long conversation with them and was returned to Earth. A second encounter occurred a few years later. Mario began to study physics and soon began plans to build a magnetic motor.</p>

<p>A STRANGE OCCURRENCE: THE ONBOARD ENCOUNTER OF COMMANDER HORATIO R. PENROSE. On May 13, 1954, Commander Horatio Penrose was driving near Derby, England when a brilliant light swooped over his car. The next thing he knew, he was waking up in a hospital recovering from head injuries. As time passed, he recalled that immediately after the accident he was pulled onboard a craft by human-looking ETs who were interested in his work with radar in the Navy. Later, Commander Penrose located a witness who had seen the UFO hovering over his car.</p>

<p>“THESE WERE NOT EARTH PEOPLE”: THE ONBOARD ENCOUNTERS OF MIMI GORZELLE. On the afternoon of May 30, 1965, Mimi Gorzelle lay on the roof of her cottage at Mason Lake, Wisconsin when a UFO appeared. To her shock, she saw two gray ETs looking at her from the portholes. The next thing she knew, the craft was leaving and four hours had passed. Afterwards, she meditated on the incident and recalled that she was taken onboard by the grays. A few months later, she was taken onboard again and saw human-looking figures who showed interest in her psychic abilities.</p>
 
<p>“I DIDN’T EVEN KNOW WHAT A UFO WAS.”: THE ONBOARD ENCOUNTER OF CARLOS ALBERTO DIAZ. Around 3:50 am on January 5, 1975, Carlos Alberto Diaz was walking with two friends to his home in Puerto Ingeniero White, Argentina when a UFO appeared overhead. Carlos was was pulled onboard in full view of his two friends. Inside, he met three greenish humanoids wearing tan, rubbery suits who began to take hair samples. Carlos passed out and woke up hours later, and more than 400 miles away. Rushed to the hospital, he was examined by 47 officials who became convinced of his encounter.</p>

<p>TAKEN FROM THE BACK YARD: THE ONBOARD ENCOUNTER OF VLADIMIR KHARITONOV. On January 15, 1978, student Vladimir Kharitonov went to visit his parents in Pskov, Russia. Going outside, he was shocked to see three humanoid figures dressed in metallic suits in the backyard. Next to them was a small craft with a transparent dome. Vladimir accepted an invitation to enter the craft, and suddenly realized that the craft was flying upwards. Fearing he was being taken away, he became hostile and fought the ETs. He promptly passed out and woke up lying in his parents’ backyard.</p>

<p>PSYCHOANALYZED BY THE GRAYS: THE ONBOARD ENCOUNTER OF BRIAN X. On February 24, 2011, Brian (pseudonym) was in his home in Lee's Summit, Missouri when colored lights entered his bedroom, putting him into a trance. He felt a small hand grab his. The next thing he knew, he was lying on a table being examined by three gray ETs. To his amazement, he had the impression that the craft itself was a living being, and that it was psychically connected to the grays. He sensed that the grays were there to help him. After being examined, he was returned to his bedroom.</p>

<p>Seven encounters, each providing a tantalizing glimpse into the what it’s like to be taken onboard a UFO. Each case provides another piece of the puzzle and adds to our knowledge of ET contact. There are too many cases to explain away. UFOs are real; we are being visited.</p>

Many questions remain regarding the nature and origin of UFO entities, which is why continuing research and documentation is so important. In this video I present ten little-known cases from across the world, from the 1940s to the 2010s. Many different types of humanoids are represented, gray ETs, short little beings, human-looking ETs, very tall figures and more. Many involve multiple witnesses and various forms of evidence. These ten cases provide a tantalizing glimpse into the very heart of the UFO phenomenon: face-to-face contact with extraterrestrials.

UFO LANDING DURING WWII. One summer day in 1942, thirteen-year-old Madeleine Arnoux was bicycling near Verger, France. Stopping to pick some berries, she was shocked to see a saucer-shaped craft and several dark-suited humanoids. Frozen in fear, she bent down to get her bike. There was a blast of wind and the craft was gone. But the memory remained for the rest of her life.

“THEY WERE DIFFERENT FROM US.” On the night of October 25, 1954, two 12-year-old boys were minding sheep in the fields near Appignano, Italy when they came upon three tiny beings wearing shiny suits, standing next to a strange craft. The beings promptly fled into the craft which took off. The boys' encounter earned national news, especially when another witness was found.

“THEY WERE HOLDING HANDS.” On the night of August 10, 1962, “J” awoke to find his bedroom filled with light. Looking into the backyard of his home in Vienna, Virginia, he saw a small flying saucer, and next to it were three skinny figures with large bald heads, huge dark eyes, and gray skin. They were holding hands, and J had the strong impression they were his friends.

THE ALIENS IN THE CORNFIELD. At 9:30 pm on July 19, 1967 Maria de Figueiredo picked corn from her father’s field in Sao Benedito do Sul, Brazil. Hearing a weird sound, she turned around and saw a three-foot-tall being staring at her. Behind him was a small craft with another being inside it. The being held up an ear of corn and gestured at her. As the being returned to the craft, Maria became terrified and promptly fainted.

“THERE IS SOMEONE IN THE HOUSE!” One evening in June of 1973, Louise Gaudet woke up in her home in Alma, Quebec, Canada hearing an engine noise and watching a green mist come into her room. Through the mist, she saw a small humanoid form wearing a silver suit and a helmet. It appeared twice, and in the days that followed, Louise began to have very unusual alien dreams.

“I FELT TRANSFIXED WITH FEAR.” As Phil Shepherdson drove his scooter to work one morning in February 1979 in Easingwold, UK, he was amazed to see a small craft landed alongside the road. Stopping to look at it, he saw two very thin humanoid figures standing next to it, and one inside it. All three stopped and looked at him. Suddenly he felt a strong telepathic connection with the beings. Phil was overcome with fear, and fled. Arriving at work, he discovered he was late, and may have had missing time.

ET SURVEILLANCE. On September 25, 1983, a young couple was camping out near Playa de Salgueiros, Portugal, when they were woken up by a strange noise. Looking outside, they saw three craft and four humanoid figures. The humanoids began to walk around, surveying the field. For the next few hours, the craft remained flying back and forth as if looking for something, before finally leaving.

A HUMANOID BEHIND EACH WINDOW. On December 31, 1997, eight children decided to camp behind their homes in rural Kenwick, Western Australia. As one of them noticed strange streaks of red light in the distant sky, he called it to the attention of his friends. Suddenly a large craft zoomed towards them. And through the windows, they saw humanoids looking down at them.

THE PURPLE LIGHT BEING. On the night of December 21, 2004, a man and his nephew noticed a glowing object outside their home in Chillicothe, Ohio. Going to investigate, they were amazed when humanoid forms emerged from it, and one flew down and approached them. It was a glowing purple light being. The witness reached out and shook its hand. It then floated back and departed. Unknown to him, numerous people in the area were having encounters.

THE GIANT ALIEN. On the night of August 21, 2014, three friends decided to meditate in a field near their homes in Talavera de la Reina, Spain. Suddenly a glowing object appeared over their heads. Moments later, they were confronted by a giant figure at least 12 feet tall. When it started to chase them, all three men fled in fear. The next day, one of them found strange landing traces.

These ten cases show how truly strange and bizarre contact with UFO entities can be. So many different kinds of craft. So many varieties of humanoids. One thing that remains very consistent is that the experience always affects the witnesses profoundly, proving to them firsthand that we are not alone in this infinite universe.

This video presents the high strangeness ET contacts of Kelli Anderson (pseudonym) from southern California. Her story involves a wide variety of paranormal entities and events, including ghosts, extraterrestrials, UFOs and missing time, psychic and paranormal events, OBEs, nature spirits, precognition, orb visitations, weird owl stories, an apparent miracle and more.

Kelli Anderson was only eight years old when she experienced her first visitation by strange entities. She was living with her father, mother, and older sister in a rural home in Escondido. She was excited because she had just gotten her own room. One evening in 1968, she had just gone to bed and closed her eyes when a low rumbling sound filled the room followed by the sense of a presence, and a glowing red light illuminating the interior of her bedroom. Kelly was too afraid to open her eyes and lay there in terror until the presence departed. It was to be the first of many strange events. She found out that both her mother and grandmother had also reported a wide variety of paranormal activity. She herself became drawn towards spirituality.

At age eleven, a traumatic event altered the course of her life. Her parents moved to the town of Julian, and Kelli found herself in an isolated rural area surrounded by huge forests and mountains. It was the ideal place to heal from the recent terrible events she had endured. She developed a great love for nature, and especially trees. This led to a series of very unusual lucid dream encounters with a nature spirit. At the same time, she and her family experienced ghostly activity in their new home, and Kelli had more visitations by strange entities. She didn’t know who or what they were, but they did not appear to be human.

Then, at age twelve, Kelli had a dramatic UFO encounter that resulted in missing time. It was an encounter that would become buried in amnesia for many years. Not long after this, a disappointing Christmas morning led to one of the most miraculous events of her entire life, an encounter so strange, wonderful, and mysterious that to this very day she struggles to understand it. She continued to have more powerful premonitions and realized that she was exhibiting a strong psychic ability.

Then she met a Native American boy who lived on the nearby Santa Ysabel Indian Reservation. Spending lots of time there, she experienced more profoundly unusual and inexplicable events. Then, when her boyfriend joined the Army, they decided to get married so they could remain together. Kelli traveled with him to Germany, where she became pregnant. It was then that she was visited by strange troll-like entities who came into her bedroom and seemed to be interested in her unborn baby. She gave birth to a healthy baby boy, but as he grew up, he also began to complain of entities coming into his room too.

Time passed, and Kelli and her husband ending up getting a divorce. It was a difficult time in her life. That’s when Kelli had an experience with magical glowing orbs entering into her bedroom and bringing a sense of joy and love that healed her of her depression. But strange events continued, including a lifelong series of weird owl encounters. But soon, one incredibly profound and unusual owl experience would occur which left her and her children utterly amazed.

Driven to do more research to understand her encounters, Kelli learned that the Native Americans have some profoundly interesting theories regarding the nature of “little people” and aliens, and that many of them have encountered a wide variety of unusual entities. She soon realized that she was very likely an ET contactee, though she leaves her interpretations open as to what exactly this means. She also received a another visitation by the nature spirit from her childhood, who answered some of the many questions she had surrounding that very strange series of encounters.

Strange events continued, including her home filling with eerie blue and green light on multiple occasions, one of which was witnessed by a visiting friend. Kelli now accepts the fact that her life has always been filled with mysterious and supernatural events, and that such things a normal part of her life.

UFOs appear in virtually all forms of media. Advertising, video-games, feature films, literature, radio, podcasts, social media platforms on the internet, and especially television. Countless documentaries, dramas, and reality TV shows have explored every facet of this subject. One form of television program that has prominently featured UFOs is the situation comedy.

Situation comedies first appeared on television in 1947, coinciding almost exactly with the dawn of the Modern Age of UFOs. Sitcoms are well-known for being accurate yardsticks measuring the current state of American culture. Sitcoms have the unique domain to express current values and morals. Whether it’s the wholesome family image of The Brady Bunch, or the satirical sarcasm of Married with Children, sitcoms broadcast a powerful message. They tell us what to wear, how to behave and what to believe in.

Sitcoms have tackled many controversial issues such as sexuality, crime, corruption, religion, economics, mental health, politics, racism, drugs, mortality, and more. And of course, one highly controversial subject covered by many sitcoms is the UFO phenomenon. Nearly every aspect of the UFO phenomenon has come under intense scrutiny and study. One avenue, however, that’s remained largely unexplored is how UFOs have been portrayed on situation comedies.

This video explores two dozen high-profile sitcoms that have had the courage to present this controversial subject, and then we will see what the treatment of this subject has to say about America’s attitude toward the UFO phenomenon. The sitcoms are presented chronologically in order of appearance, and reflect how Americans’ perception and understanding of UFOs changes over the decades.

Thousands of people have had the experience, if not millions: a face-to-face meeting with extraterrestrials. Cases come from all over the world, and they share profound commonalities and differences. It appears that the humanoid form is the universal template. And yet, many cases have rare or unique elements of high strangeness that defy comprehension. This article/video presents ten cases of this kind. These cases have much to teach us about the UFO phenomenon and these strange visitors to our planet.

THEY CAME BACK. One night in September of 1951, Louise McDougall, her husband and three friends sat on the lawn of their homes in Bloomington, California. Sensing somebody looking at her, Louise saw a disc-shaped craft with portholes hover overhead. Through the portholes, she saw four human-looking men in jumpsuits looking down at her. She grabbed her flashlight and shone it at the craft, causing it to dart away. But 15 minutes later, it was back again!

“WE RAN AS FAST AS WE COULD.” One summer day in 1958, 11-year-old Hilary Porter and her friend Janet were walking near their homes in Farnborough, UK when a  silver craft appeared overhead. It promptly descended, a door opened, and a tall humanoid figure appeared in the doorway. After a few moments of shock, the girls fled. Soon, Hilary would learn that she was a UFO contactee.

HUMANOIDS IN GOSHEN. On the night of October 19, 1973, Mrs. Wright reported a UFO over her home in Goshen, Ohio. Researcher Charles Wilhelm arrived to visit her, but instead interviewed her neighbor, “Sam,” who described coming upon a landed UFO and humanoids. He wasn’t the only witness. Two weeks later and a short distance away, Don Brandenburg came upon a landed UFO. Later that night, a Mrs. Gilbert saw a strange humanoid in the exact same spot.

THE GOFFSTOWN VISITATIONS. On the afternoon of November 4, 1973, Rex Snow of Goffstown, New Hampshire (and his neighbors) saw a flying saucer. That night, an odd light filled his backyard. Looking outside, he saw two humanoids in silver jumpsuits collecting samples from his yard. Three days earlier and 6 miles away, Florence Dow was scared by the appearance of a faceless humanoid on her porch. Six hours later, Lyndia Morel had a scary encounter with a UFO and humanoid in Goffstown. Meanwhile, police stations across the state were flooded with UFO calls.

THE MONK-LIKE ALIENS. On the night of November 13, 1973, Ann Dolphijn Vermeulen woke to see three strange humanoid figures outside the window of her home in Uden, Netherlands. She watched them for five minutes as they walked down the street and move away. Returning to her bedroom and looking out the window, she saw a large glowing red sphere.

THE GLOWING MEN. At 6:30 on August 15, 1981, more than twenty people who worked at the La Rochelle estate in Zimbabwe were amazed by the appearance of a glowing sphere and two to four glowing humanoid figures in white jumpsuits. Panic reigned as several witnesses fled into the forests. Others stayed to see the sphere move around the estate. Soon the figures left, leaving behind an enduring mystery.

IT CAME FROM THE SKY. One day in spring 2003, three cement truck drivers arrived at their destination in Reinoso de Cerrato, Spain just in time to see a bizarre-looking humanoid descend from the sky and stand on the ground 30 feet away. The being was 5 feet tall, dressed in a jumpsuit, but its head appeared to be composed only of a hollow transparent ring. After a few moments, the figure flew back upwards and disappeared into the distance.

THE ALIENS BY THE MEGALITHS. One day in February 2008, two women were visiting Ile de Berder, France to see the many mysterious megalithic structures at this location. Instead they saw a strange glowing sphere followed by the appearance of four gray ETs. One of the witnesses was left with the impression that she was being warned about the dangers of nuclear power.

THE ALIEN IN MY BEDROOM. On the night of November 9, 2013, “Melissa,” was in the bedroom of her home in Virginia Beach, VA when a strange feeling overcame her. Looking up, she saw a tall gray-skinned humanoid appear in her room. She was unable to move as it approached. She felt herself being drawn upwards and blacked out. The next morning, her brother complained about the dogs barking furiously and a brilliant light appearing outside the home.

THE WITHLACOOCHEE ET. On the night of April 2, 2015, “Philip” was driving an 18-wheeler truck on State Road 41 in the Withlacoochee Forest in Florida when he noticed a short, uniformed figure holding a strange device standing alongside the road. As he passed by, he saw that it did not appear to be human. This turned out to be one of several encounters occurring in this area.

Ten cases, each providing more evidence of the extraterrestrial presence on our planet. The truth can no longer be denied, ignored, or explained away. We are being visited by ETs.

It has been called the ultimate UFO encounter, the closest of all encounters: an onboard UFO experience. There are thousands of well-documented cases, and some researchers believe they may number in the millions. These cases of direct contact with ETs involve extensive interactions and contain more information about the extraterrestrials than any other kind of encounter. Here are six shocking cases from across the world: Australia, Canada, France and three from the United States. The UFO phenomenon is so much more than just simple sightings of unexplained lights in the sky. It’s about meeting people from other worlds.

“I WAS IN A UFO.” In 1972, “Steve” (age 24) was staying in a cabin in the wilderness of Cariboo, British Columbia, Canada. One summer day, he stepped outside and was amazed to see two silver discs fly at treetop level a few hundred feet away. He somehow knew they were going to land and that he had to go meet them. He asked his girlfriend to join him, but she strangely refused. Steve went alone and came upon the two craft, landed on the ground. One had an open door and a ramp leading to the ground. Curious, Steve approached and entered. Inside he saw two short humanoids with gray wrinkled skin, wearing white doctors’ smocks. Afraid, he was about to run when one spoke telepathically in perfect English, “It’s okay, come on in.” So began an extensive onboard experience that Steve would keep secret for most of his life.

TAKEN IN TARBORO. James Howard (age 15) and his friend Brian Hollis (age 14) had been seeing odd lights near their homes in Tarboro, NC for a few weeks. Then, on the night of November 12, 1976, they saw a metallic, disc-shaped craft with colored lights land in the forest nearby. Going to investigate, they became frightened when a glowing, white-suited humanoid figure appeared. When they arrived home, more than an hour had passed. James began having nightmares of being onboard. Later, under hypnosis, he recalled that both he and Brian were floated up into the craft, separated and given medical exams.

YURANI. It was a warm night in July 1981 as “Robert” (age 16) played frisbee with his dog outside his home in Seattle, Washington. Suddenly, clouds rolled in and Robert saw colored lights overhead. He now found himself unable to move as a warm beam of light pulled him up into the craft. He recalled seeing a being with cat-like eyes, then woke up the next morning in bed. Years later, he recalled a long onboard experience where he was met by a hybrid human-gray who introduced herself as Yurani. She told him that she was more than 200 years old, and began to impart a lot of information about why the ETs were visiting Earth. At one point, Robert was taken to their home planet.

SEVEN HOURS ONBOARD AN ALIEN SPACECRAFT. Eduardo Pons Prades was a famous political author in Spain when, on the night of August 31, 1981, his life changed forever. He was driving through the Pyrenees in France when he became weirdly lost and his car mysteriously stalled. Walking down a narrow country road, he came upon a large craft landed in a field. A door opened and a commanding voice spoke to him telepathically: “Don’t be afraid. Please approach…Come up to our ship. We wish to speak with you.” Unable to resist, Eduardo went onboard and was greeted by a group of beautiful human-looking people in white jumpsuits. They told him that they had contacted him because of his expertise in human violence, and that he needed to give the world a message.

“WE ARE YOUR FRIENDS.” One night in March 1982, an anonymous woman driving near Springfield, Missouri noticed a strange light at treetop level ahead of her car. At that moment, she seemed to lose control of the steering wheel and felt like her car was floating. The next thing she knew, she was parked next to a huge craft landed in field. She was drawn onboard and was greeted by six tall, strong, human-looking figures with blue eyes and blonde hair. They examined her and said that they were researching human reproduction. They said that they were her friends and would see her again.

“WHAT DO YOU WANT US FOR?” One night in 1986, three young men were camping in the wilderness outside of Kalgoorlie, Western Australia when they heard a strange noise overhead. Looking up, a brilliant light approached and descended, revealing itself to be a silver disc-shaped craft. Two little beings appeared underneath and approached the men, who found themselves now unable to move. All three men were floated up into the craft and subjected to a strange examination involving lights. The ETs were friendly and smiling as the witnesses were given a tour of the craft and soon saw something which left them speechless with wonder.

Six shocking onboard UFO encounters, each providing profound insights into the nature and origins of extraterrestrials, each providing answers about the ET agenda on our planet. We are not alone!

While there are still those who remain skeptical of UFOs and extraterrestrials, there are many who not only believe, they KNOW. They have moved beyond belief to actual experiential knowledge. A firsthand encounter with extraterrestrials changes the way a person views the universe. They know beyond doubt that we are not alone in this universe. And a lot of people have had this kind of experience. This video presents ten firsthand accounts of people who have met humanoids face-to-face. These cases come from all over the world. They show that we are not the only people in this universe. We are one of many!

THE ALIENS AND THE SHEPHERD BOY. In the Summer of 1938, Mariano Melgar, a seven-year-old shepherd boy from Munico, Spain was minding his family’s herd of cows when an ET craft landed nearby. A door opened and three men stepped out. Mariano approached to get a closer look and one of them shot him with a beam of light. Mariano thought they might be from another country. Later he would change his mind.

USO AND HUMANOID AT LAKE LANGELMAVESI. When Ilona Johansson-Paasonen went to enjoy a vacation in August 1945 at Lake Langelmavesi, Finland, she was awakened one morning by light blazing into her room. Looking outside, she saw a fiery object zoom towards her. She dove to the ground in fear. Peering outside again, she saw two figures in a boat that clearly was not normal. Weirdly, she passed out.

THE ALIENS AT THE WATER FOUNTAIN. On the night of December 24, 1950, ten-year-old Antonietta Chiara was sent outside her home in Cossoine, Italy to fetch a pail of water. Going to the nearby fountain, she saw three thin humanoid figures with oversized heads and big dark eyes, and all three were staring right at her. Realizing they were not human, she panicked and fled.

THE MEN IN THE TRANSPARENT SPHERE. On the night of October 18, 1968, three people were enjoying dinner in their home in Medulla, Florida when suddenly the TV quit and the dog freaked out. Looking outside, they saw a transparent sphere floating near their house. And inside it were two short men working a strange device. Little did they know, people all over the area were seeing UFOs.

A UFO REPAIR CASE. One night in February 1970, Leona Nielsen and her friend were staying in a cabin near Coram, Montana when a light outside caught their attention, and they saw a classic flying saucer landed along the river shore. It seemed to be in trouble and was shooting out colored sparks over a wide area, while two human-looking figures rushed around it. Leona had the impression that the craft was damaged.

THE ETS ON THE SIDEWALK. It was 11pm on June 18, 1980 as Antonio D’Amico walked along a sidewalk in the small village of Barrancas, Argentina. Suddenly he noticed two short humanoids wearing skintight luminous jumpsuits standing a short distance away. Both were staring at him. Fearful, Antonio decided to leave. But to his shock, the strange figures followed.

ALIEN ROBOT ON THE SCHOOL PLAYGROUND. One afternoon in mid-April 1990, five children were on the playground of the Yerevan Primary School #111 in Yerevan, Armenia when a spherical object landed behind the school. Three robotic beings came out. One approached the students and spoke to them about the future of their country, but not before striking one with a beam of light and levitating another boy.

ALIENS AT SUMMER CAMP. It was 1991, the last night at summer-camp for a group of girls in Pelrhimov, Czech Republic. As they sat around the bonfire, a brilliant beam of light shone down on them. It was a UFO! The camp leaders ordered all the girls to their tents. But shortly later, a few of them sneaked out and came face-to-face with three tall humanoids in divers’ suits. The UFO remained overhead.

THE ETS BY THE CHAPEL. On the night of December 27, 2006, a college student was walking by the chapel at the University of Nairobi in Kenya, Africa when a glowing egg-shaped craft dropped from the sky and landed in front of her. Moments later, an ET emerged. The student was unable to move as two more figures appeared, then one of them approached her. Thankfully, two other students came on the scene.

THE HUNTERS BECOME THE HUNTED. It was 3am on December 12, 2011, as three hunters and one of their sons were hiking back to their car after hunting in Kaimai Ranges of New Zealand. When a glowing object appeared overhead, they became puzzled. When it moved closer and revealed itself to be a craft, they became concerned. Shortly later, they came face to face with a strange humanoid that would leave them all shaken.

These ten cases provide just a brief glimpse into the nature of contact with UFOs and extraterrestrials. The truth is that there are thousands upon thousands of cases, each of them unique, each providing another piece of the puzzle that is the UFO mystery. The only thing we know for sure is that UFOs are real, and we are not alone in this universe.

UFOs are ubiquitous! They are seen everywhere on our planet. Every town, every city, everywhere! In Part Five of this ongoing you the viewers have provided nine new locations to investigate and find UFO cases. And once again, research shows that UFOs have left no place behind. Eugene, Oregon----Homewood, Illinois----Niagara Falls, New York & Ontario Canada----Glenwood, MN----Helena, MT----Tucson, Arizona----Monterey, CA---Rotherham, UK: all of them have been visited by extraterrestrials. That includes sightings, landings, humanoids, and onboard experiences, with many cases supported by evidence including photos, radar-returns, landing traces, medical effects, electromagnetic disturbances, animal reactions and more. We are not alone!

EUGENE, OREGON shows a long UFO history. In 1947, a married couple had a dramatic encounter with a low-level UFO. In July of 1955, the audience of a drive-in movie theater in Eugene witnessed a dazzling UFO display. Cases in 1959, 1960, 1971 and 1976, 1982, 1986, 1986—most involving multiple witnesses, including police. In 2015, a Eugene woman saw gray aliens in her bedroom. In 2016 a witness captured startling photos of a UFO.
HOMEWOOD, ILLINOIS is a suburb of Chicago with a few impressive accounts. On April 28, 1952, two witnesses observed a silver-white dome-shaped object flying circles around an airplane. They called the US Army Regional office who routed the case to Blue Book. But the Air Force wasn’t interested! On November 8, 1973, three sightings hit the Chicago area, including Homewood, and then moved over a shopping center!

NIAGARA FALLS, NEW YORK & ONTARIO, CANADA have been visited many times. A very early and impressive sighting occurred in 1833. All throughout the 1950s numerous sightings occurred , many involving military witnesses. In 1955, two families picnicking near the falls saw a USO emerge from Lake Erie. They all saw humanoids inside the craft. In 1958, a woman saw a UFO landed by the highway, leaving landing traces. In 1960, a young man had a UFO talk to him, then follow him home and take him onboard. In 1963, airport tower personnel saw a UFO which Project Blue Book said was just a balloon! More cases throughout the 1970s to the 2000s!

GLENWOOD, MINNESOTA was visited on September 25, 1954 when dozens of people over a wide area reported UFOs. In 2003, Cindy Lou Schmidt not only saw a UFO from the porch of her Glenwood home, she managed to capture a photograph of it. MUFON field investigators declared the case unknown.

HELENA, MONTANA had sighting way back in 1947 when a massive fleet of 12 objects flew over the city. In 1973, cement truck driver John Struble was at Flesher Pass when a UFO sent down a beam of light disabling his truck and scaring the daylights out of him. In 1976, numerous people across Helena called the police to say that UFOs were zooming over the city.

TUCSON, ARIZONA is the location of hundreds of encounters. Here we look at nearly a dozen cases involving humanoids and onboard encounters. In 1952, a woman hiking outside of Tucson saw a UFO, then a gray walk up to her and she then found herself inside a craft. In 1960, Charlie Green was pulled out of his home by four grays. Unknown to him, someone outside his home watched him being taken. In 1977, a woman saw a UFO land next to the Veterans Hospital. A silver-suited humanoid came out and pulled her onboard, holding a long conversation with her. In 1981, a woman saw a UFO outside her home, was taken onboard and saw three different types of ETs. In 2001, a teenage boy made a wish to see an alien, and moments later saw a flying humanoid. In 2007, a woman sent a telepathic hello to a UFO. That night, she found herself being visited by humanoids.

MONTEREY, CALIFORNIA has several impressive encounters. In April 10, 1950, numerous policemen saw had a daylight encounter with a shiny silver disc. Even a prisoner saw it! In 1950, a train engineer had a dramatic encounter as a UFO paced his train. In 1967, a UFO hovered 100 feet over a farmhouse. In 1973, a low-level UFO was viewed by police. That same year, Fort Hunter-Liggett Army base had a very dramatic encounter and also possibly a UFO crash with bodies. In 1974, several residents of an apartment building all called the police to report a fast-moving egg-shaped object. In 2017, a “cloaked” cylindrical craft moved over the city.

ROTHERHAM, UK was the location of a spooky humanoid goat-man seen back in 1937. The years of 1977, 1981, 1987, 1988 and 1997 produced many spectacular cases. More cases occur, even as late as 2001 when witnesses reported a craft moving with a strange pendulum motion.
The cases speak for themselves. All over the world UFOs are being seen. UFO activity is far more common and widespread than previously thought. It appears that the ETs want us to know they are here! The truth is obvious: UFOs are seen all over the planet, including your own hometown.

While there are still many questions surrounding the origin of UFOs and their occupants, the most popular theory is that they are from the stars, in other words: extraterrestrial. This video presents twelve cases from across the world involving a wide variety of ETs. These reports are supported by a wide variety of evidence: photos, medical effects, landing traces, animal reactions, electromagnetic disturbances and more. It’s time for this subject to be taken seriously by everyone on this planet.

THE HUMANOID IN THE FIREBALL. One evening in the Summer of 1961, “Mike” (age 7) was camping with his buddy in the backyard of his home in Anaheim, California. Suddenly a fiery object swooped down and hovered overhead. Inside, he saw a humanoid figure looking down at him.

THE ALIEN UNDER THE BRIDGE. A summer day in 1963, a group of children were playing in a park in Lesnica, Poland when a silver-suited short humanoid appeared next to them. Time seemed to move in slow motion as the figure gestured at them to come closer. The children fled, and refused to return to the park again.

THE LITTLE ETS IN THE TINY UFO. On November 15, 1969, Madame X looked out the window of her apartment in downtown Nancy, France and saw a tiny UFO glide towards her window, stop and hover. Inside she saw two tiny little ETs smiling and looking right at her. It zoomed away. Afterward, the witness discovered her face had been slightly burned.

VISITORS TO EARTH. One summer night in 1972, a lady from Oslo, Norway saw a large saucer-shaped craft with big picture windows hovering at treetop level. Even more shocking, she saw humanoid figures bustling about inside. Oddly, although other people were around, she seemed to be the only one to see it!

A UFO PARKED BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. Late at night on September 6, 1973, two people drove along the Eyre Highway near Penong, South Australia. The passenger was asleep when a telepathic voice woke her up. Looking outside, she saw a UFO parked alongside the road. One humanoid stood next to it, and another was visible through a window.

THE ALIENS ON THE BEACH. One day in June 1975, a couple walked along Playa de Marin Beach in Spain when three UFOs appeared, landed on the beach, and out came three short humanoids dressed in jumpsuits. The three beings converged and then returned to their craft. One of the witnesses tried to communicate telepathically, but got a bad headache.

THE LITTLE MAN IN THE SILVER SUIT. One night in October 1977, Jose Benedito Santos (age 78) was hunting near Chapada das Mesas, Brazil when a glowing object landed near him. He approached and saw a short humanoid wearing a silver suit and helmet. It walked right up to him, and Jose promptly fainted. When he awoke, he found a weird mark on his neck.

THE ETS ON THE BALCONY. When four people drove near Danville, California one evening in summer of 1979, they were amazed to see a glowing object pace their car. They stopped and watched as the object came lower, revealing itself to be a saucer-shaped craft. On a balcony surrounding the craft, they saw several very tall humanoid figures. Later, they learned many people saw UFOs in that area on that night.

CONVERSATION WITH AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL. On the night of August 24, 1985, a couple (both doctors) drove along Route 12 near Ituzaingo, Argentina when a UFO blocked the road. A beautiful man dressed in a jumpsuit walked up to their window and held a long conversation with them. He told them he was from another planet, and that the people of Earth needed to know that we are not alone.

THE ALIEN FROM THE BLACK SPHERE. Throughout 1988-1989, a farming couple from San Piero a Sieve, Italy experienced repeated visits by a flying humanoid which would arrive in black sphere. It warned them to keep away, but then damaged their crops. After several visits, the husband rushed forward to stop the ET. It quickly struck him with a beam of light. That was the final visit.

A NIGHT IN THE TREE WITH ALIENS. On May 17, 1997, three teenage boys became lost in the wilderness of La Rumorosa, Mexico. Taking refuge in a tree for the night, a saucer appeared overhead, followed shortly by several glowing short humanoids. The humanoids soon discovered the boys and actually climbed the tree to observe them. The witnesses' lives were profoundly changed forever.

THE ET WHO WALKED ON WATER. One day in 1999, a man was hiking next to a pond in a natural area near Corner Brook, Newfoundland, Canada when he saw a tall humanoid figure in a white jumpsuit and helmet floating inches above the water. Suddenly it noticed him and glided across the surface of the water, running off into the forest.

These 12 cases alone make it undeniable that we are being visited by extraterrestrials, but the truth is that there are thousands of more cases. It is no longer possible to deny the truth of the ET presence on our planet. The evidence is clear: we are not alone!

Some UFO encounters are so incredibly weird, that after it occurs people can hardly believe that it actually happened! This episode presents eight cases from across the world of truly high strangeness, each involving close encounters of the second kind, in which the environment is affected in some way. Many of these cases have multiple witnesses, and virtually all of them involve some form of evidence: radar confirmation, photographs, landing traces, physiological effects, animal reactions, electromagnetic disturbances. These are the kinds of cases that simply cannot be denied.

UFO COLLIDES INTO A HOUSE. On April 23, 1966, Jeanne Kalnicki and her six kids were shocked to see a UFO hovering right outside their home in Dorchester, Massachusetts. It fact, it was so close, they thought it might hit them. It moved off, but just a few hours later, it was back, and this time it ran right into the side of their apartment building, causing the whole structure to vibrate and the power to go out. And this was just one of many sightings occurring in this area at that time.

A UFO WITH A MESSAGE. The night of December 12, 1967 would change the life of Rita Malley forever. As she drove with her young son near Ithaca, New York, a UFO began to follow her down the highway. Suddenly it struck her car with a beam of light, pulling it off the road. Then chorus of voices spoke to her, delivering a message that would chill her to the bone. The very next day, Rita learned that the message from the UFO was absolutely accurate. This case was just one of hundreds in the same area around the same time.

A VERY HOT UFO. Around 10:50 pm on August 13, 1970, patrolman Evald Maarup was driving near Haderslev, Denmark when his car and the surrounding area became illuminated by a blindingly brilliant light. As the engine and electrical system failed, Evald looked up and saw a UFO right above his car. Suddenly the interior of his vehicle became hot as a summer day. As it finally darted away, he managed to capture three photos of the object. Soon the UFOs would return, not only to him, but to others!

A SILVER UFO WITH PRONGS. One evening in October 1973, Mary Rose and her 11-year-old son Teddy were walking near their home in Wilcoe, West Virginia when a UFO dropped down and hovered a telephone-pole height overhead. Fear filled them as they watched two prong-like things come out from the bottom of the craft. Both could feel a weird sensation of heat and electricity, and thought that they were about to be taken into the craft. They ran and hid, and to their relief, the UFO darted away.

STRUCK BY A BEAM OF LIGHT FROM A UFO. Around dusk on June 17, 1977, Dale Schexnaider, and two children, Jena (age 14) and Krissy (age 11) were walking to their car at Cotile Lake in Louisiana when a UFO appeared. Suddenly it came right over their heads, sending down multiple beams of light which struck them on the solar plexus. They were unable to move and saw with shock that their entire bodies were glowing with electric-blue light. Hours later, a tragic event occurred which seemed connected to their sighting in some indefinable way.

ALIEN FOOTPRINTS? On the night of September 4, 1979, Jerzy Wasilewski left his 4th floor apartment in Wroclaw, Poland to take a short walk. He left his kitchen window open. Returning later, he was shocked to see 17 strange footprints leading from the open window, meandering around his kitchen and hallway, and going back to the open window. The prints looked like burn-marks from some strange creature. But a later analysis revealed that these prints were something much more strange and inexplicable.

I WAS TRYING HARD TO HOLD ONTO REALITY. On the night of March 8, 1982, “John” and his wife were in their home in Bethel, Connecticut when the whole house began to shake. Fearing an earthquake, they ran outside only to be confronted by a massive shadowy object with scores of tiny red lights lining its edges. John later found out that there were dozens of other witnesses in the area, some who saw the same object and also reported very strange effects.

HIGH STRANGENESS IN SLOCINA. At 10:42 pm on December 27, 2013, Ewa looked outside the window of her home in Slocina, Poland and saw a huge glowing UFO at treetop level. She called to her mother, Anna and both watched the object approach. Suddenly the sound from their loud radio disappeared and time seemed to move in slow motion. As the craft passed over a streetlamp, it pulled the light away from the streetlamp, as if it had some kind of forcefield that could bend light.

These eight case, all close encounters of the second kind, show that UFOs can affect the environment (and the witnesses) in weird and unusual ways that defy comprehension. Cases like these have much to teach us about these strange craft visiting our planet, and the behavior of the occupants inside them.

A close encounter of third kind: meetings with humanoids. This happens more often than most people think. There are thousands upon thousands of cases on record, coming from all over the world. This episode presents ten cases of extraterrestrial humanoid encounters you probably haven’t heard before. Short and tall humanoids, human-looking ETs, robotic beings, grays…and more. Each case reveals remarkable insights into the nature of UFO contact, what they are doing, and why they are here.

PLANT-PICKING ETS. One morning in July 1954, Harold Carpenter woke up to hear a buzzing noise coming from the woods near his home in Temple Ewell, England. When it happened several times, he went to investigate, and came upon a landed UFO and five short humanoids. They were using tweezer-like instruments to place twigs and leaves in small jars. Seeing Harold, they fled into their craft, and flew off.

SOMETHING ABNORMAL. Driving near Girona, Spain one night in October 1958, Jose Luis Angelo observed a UFO descend into the forest. Suspecting a plane crash, he pulled over and ventured into the forest. Instead, he came upon a UFO hovering above the ground. Next to it were two short, large-headed humanoids wearing jumpsuits. He watched for 15 minutes until they returned to their craft and departed.

I WANT TO GO FOR A RIDE! As 13-year-old Maria Ivanovna returned to her home in Vitebsk, Belarus one day in July of 1963, she saw two metallic discs overhead. Suddenly her 4-year-old brother ran towards them, and one of the discs swooped down apparently to pick him up. Maria’s sister grabbed him and pulled him away just in time. But they were all close enough to see a four-foot-tall humanoid sitting inside a transparent dome on top of the craft.

THE WINSTED ENCOUNTERS. On the night of September 15, 1967, two teen-age girls looked out the window and saw a glowing UFO crisscrossing the fields behind one of their homes in Winsted, Connecticut. Moments later, they heard a noise in the barn, and saw two short humanoids with big heads run across their yard. Soon a third one appeared. This was just the first of a wave of encounters that put Winsted on the UFO map.

BLUE RIDGE HUMANOID. On the night of March 1, 1974, Billy Wayne Plasters saw an odd glow on the hill near his farm in Vesta, Virginia. Alerting his family, they all observed a strange craft ascend and dart away. When the strange glow remained, Billy and his brother-in-law drove to the area and came upon a landed craft and a tall “well-built” humanoid. They tried to talk to it, but when it moved towards them, they panicked and fled. Later, they found a huge burned spot.

THE SHINY SILVER SEWICKLEY HUMANOID. In January of 1974, numerous people across central Pennsylvania reported UFOs. Many reported that they were chased down the highway by strange craft. But events came to a climax on the night of March 24 when a young man was motorcycling in a rural area of Sewickley and caught a tall, silver-clad humanoid figure by surprise. The figure crouched and then darted away, leaving behind strange footprints.

THE SWEET-SMELLING ALIEN. Hearing footsteps outside his home in Villorba, Italy on the night of June 25, 1974, Mr. DP went outside and saw his cat was bristling with fear. He also smelled a strange sweet odor. Sensing a presence, he was then shocked by the appearance of a glowing humanoid in a shiny skin-tight jumpsuit. The strange being quickly floated up into the sky and was gone. Mr. DP was stunned and after his encounter, had a headache that persisted for a full week.

THE ET WITH THE FLASHING EYES. At 9pm one evening in July 1975, Carmen B stepped outside of her home in St. Dizier, France to hang her laundry. Without warning, the yard was flooded with light. Turning around, she saw a short humanoid staring at her. It had a huge head and large flashing eyes that left her hypnotized and paralyzed with fear. She almost fainted from shock, but managed to break free and flee into the house.

THE ETS IN THE FOREST. On the afternoon of February 14, 1984, a group of young children playing in the Tuchola Forest near their homes in Linowek, Poland saw a small craft descend downward. At least two metallic-looking short humanoids frightened the children who fled to their homes. Investigators had the children draw what they saw. Later, landing traces were found.

AN INTERRUPTED JOURNEY. At 4:30 pm on August 25, 1999, mechanic Carlos Colon’s truck mysteriously stalled along National Route 5 near Trenque Lauquen, Argentina. Five tall figures in a glowing dome appeared in front of him. Suddenly, the beings turned away and they disappeared. Carlos found himself standing in a field some distance away. After the encounter, numerous psychic and paranormal events occurred.

Ten more cases showing once more that we are not alone in the Universe. It’s time for the world to face this fact. UFOs are real. Extraterrestrials are here!

Welcome to Episode Four of my ongoing series of “UFOS IN YOUR HOMETOWN.” I have put out a challenge to anyone interested in this subject: name any location, such as your hometown, and I bet I can find a UFO encounter there. Hundreds of people responded. I am working my way down the list of locations. In this episode I investigate eight places: Fort Wayne, IN----Greenock, Scotland----Warsaw, Poland----New Paltz, NY----St Charles, MO----Boston, MA----van horn, TX----Grand Junction, CO. And guess what, there are cases in each of these areas! Sightings, landings, humanoids, onboard encounters…supported by eyewitness testimonies, photos, radar-returns, landing traces, medical effects and more. Has your hometown been visited? The answer is probably YES!

FORT WAYNE, INDIANA. On February 7, 1955, American Airlines Flight 266 had a dramatic encounter with five UFO. In 1955, the Freeman family of Fort Wayne all watched a classic flying saucer. In 1967, minister Allen Federspiel reported his amazing sighting to NICAP. That same year, dozens of people saw a UFO hovering over Fort Wayne for four hours. In 1979, Sally Collet saw a UFO with a humanoid inside it right outside her home, and she wasn’t the only one. In 1991, a lady in Fort Wayne was chased by a UFO for 25 minutes. In 2005, another witness had a dramatic missing time encounter. The cases continue!

GREENOCK, SCOTLAND. Sightings, UFO fleets, humanoids, UFO photos…Greenock has them all. Back in 1948, two schoolgirls saw multiple UFOs hover overhead. One hovered so low, they could see a humanoid figure inside. They waved at it, and it waved back! Truly dramatic low-level sightings occurred in 1973, 1978 and 1999, including a case involving a fleet of UFOs. In 2005, Jonathan Smith heard shouting in the street and looking out his window, saw a group of colorful objects. He grabbed his camera and snapped an amazing photograph. These are just a few of the many cases in Greenock.

WARSAW, POLAND. Warsaw has an astonishing number of close encounter cases. In 1922, a Warsaw family observed a silver craft hover 400 feet away, so close, they thought they were about to be taken onboard. In 1959, an engineer observed a craft hovering over the Warsaw Palace of Culture and Science. In 1975, a man was in the forests outside of Warsaw when he saw two gray-type ETs who rendered him temporarily paralyzed. In 1979, a man came so close to a landed craft, it burned his face. In 1986, a plumber was taken onboard a craft where he saw froglike beings. So many other cases!

NEW PALTZ, NEW YORK. Per whistleblower Robert S. Carr, a UFO landed in New Paltz, and a humanoid was captured by a game warden, and was taken alive to CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia until it died. This is one of many New Paltz cases. In 1970, a woman and her boyfriend had a dramatic missing time encounter. Another dramatic case occurred in 1978 when three separate groups of witnesses observed a strange triangular craft over the city.

ST CHARLES, MISSOURI. One morning in 1971, three people, including a doctor, observed a low-level cone-shaped craft with a humanoid inside it. In 1973, the police received a call from a UFO witness. They sent out an officer, and he saw it himself. Soon many other witnesses saw it. In 1998, a witness described his sighting of a cigar-shaped craft with portholes on it.

BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS. Sightings here reach back to 1638, when a group of witnesses saw a UFO for three hours. In 1950, a dramatic UFO display involving multiple craft occurred over Logan International Airport. In 1955, a man reported his sighting of a craft as big as a 10-story building. In May 1963, a group of witnesses witnessed a fleet of UFOs over a drive-in theater. In 2024, a boyfriend and a girlfriend were stunned when a UFO shined a beam of light on their car, causing it to noticeably shake.

VAN HORN, TEXAS. This small town had an undeniable encounter with a classic flying saucer when, on July 23, 1999, truckers driving along Interstate 10 observed a craft with blue and white lights zigzagging at low level alongside the highway.

GRAND JUNCTION, COLORADO. In 1956, four people were shocked by the appearance of metallic discs flying only 1500 feet overhead. In 1968, a man driving near Grand Junction saw a UFO that was so bright, it hurt his eyes to look at it. In 1969, two young men were walking down Main Street when a silver saucer with windows hovered for two minutes in view of hundreds of people. In 1985, Bob White was driving outside of Grand Junction when a UFO ejected a piece of metal right in front of him. He scooped it up, and had it studied by metallurgists who were unable to account for its composition. These are just a few of the many fascinating cases in Grand Junction.

It appears that every location on Earth has a long and rich history of UFO encounters. The evidence speaks for itself. We are being visited by extraterrestrials.

An onboard UFO encounter is the most extensive of all UFO cases, and there are a lot of them. According to the Roper Polling organization, as many as one in fifty people show the markers of being UFO contactees. An onboard experience is far more common than most people know, and the fact is, most people remain silent about their encounters. This video presents six incredible accounts from across the world of people who have been onboard an extraterrestrial craft. These cases are not only fascinating, they have a lot to teach us about the ET agenda.

CONTACT IN CALGARY. At 5:45 pm on November 16, 1967, fourteen-year-old David Seewaldt was walking to his home in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. It should have been a three-minute walk. But suddenly a craft covered with colored lights appeared overhead and struck him with a beam of light. Running home, he realized he was missing forty minutes of time. Then, six months later, he had a dream where he remembered what happened during the missing time: he was taken onboard. Later, under hypnosis, he recalled all the details, including being pulled onboard and being examined by reptilian-like entities.

CONTACT IN LOXLEY. On October 17, 1973, Clarence Ray Patterson (a 31-year-old electrician) was driving his pickup truck eastbound on Highway 10 near Loxley, Alabama when a cigar-shaped craft appeared overhead. It sent down a beam of light and pulled Clarence and his truck onboard. Inside the craft, Clarence was confronted by six robotic-like entities who pulled him from the truck and proceeded to examine him. Twenty minutes later, Clarence and his truck were set down 29 miles away, now in Florida. Unknown to Clarence, scores of people across the southwest saw UFOs and humanoids on that same night.

CONTACT IN VENADO TUERTO. At 6:45 am on September 6, 1978, twelve-year-old Juan Oscar Perez exited his ranch-house in Venado Tuerto, Argentina to round up the family’s horses. Suddenly a UFO appeared overhead, spooking the horses. Juan fled home in fear, but his father made him return to the area to collect the horses. Going to the horse pasture, Juan came upon a landed craft. A door opened and out stepped a tall robotic figure who invited Juan onboard the craft. Juan accepted the invitation and saw strange instruments and panels and another short robotic figure. As Juan left, he asked for an artifact to prove his encounter. The ET gave him a glove, but as he fled, they took the glove back. Both before and after Juan’s encounter, others in the area also had encounters with UFOs and humanoids.

CONTACT IN SOMMERECOURT. On July 8, 1983, Stefan Gasparovic and his family went camping in the hills near their home in Sommerecourt, Haute-Marne, France. That night, a brilliant object appeared overhead, coming back three times. The next night it appeared again, frightening the family. But on July 10, Stefan returned alone for a closer look. To his shock, the UFO appeared and dropped down right over his head. He found himself being pulled onboard. The next thing he knew, he was being dropped out of the craft several kilometers away, with vague memories of being examined by short, ugly humanoids. He was so traumatized, he couldn’t recall his own name and had to be hospitalized. Later, landing traces were found in the field where he was taken.

CONTACT IN GOODLAND. On the evening of November 7, 1989, friends Susan and Jennifer were driving between Flagler, Colorado and Goodland, Kansas when a UFO began to pace their car down the highway. At one point, it came close to their car and shone down a beam of light. The women kept driving and arrived at a motel in Goodland. That’s when they realized that a 72-mile trip had somehow taken three hours. Realizing they had missing time, they went under hypnosis, and both independently recalled being pulled from their car and taken onboard the craft, where they were separated and physical examined by gray ETs. Both held conversations with the ETs and learned the reasons behind their encounter.

CONTACT IN DEBRECEN. Late one evening in December 1990, teacher and artist Gabor Molnar was driving along Highway 35 near Debrecen, Hungary when his engine mysteriously quit and his car stopped. Suddenly he saw a “little green being” facing him from the roadside. The next thing he knew, he found himself inside a craft being examined by these beings with large black eyes. He blacked out and woke up back on the road with his car facing the wrong direction. His life would never be the same.

These six cases show what it’s like to be taken onboard a craft and examined by ETs. They provide some answers as to what happens inside a UFO, and why people are being taken onboard. They show how profoundly an encounter can affect a person in many ways. And most importantly, they add to our knowledge of this subject and provide further evidence that we are not alone in this universe.

While seeing a UFO is undeniably interesting, far more compelling are cases of UFO landings. In these cases, the extraterrestrial craft are observed from a short distance, virtually removing any chance of misperception. This video presents seven cases from across the United States involving dramatic UFO landings.

CASE ONE: UFO LANDING AT ELY.  On June 25, 1964, two brothers were driving from Spring Valley to the town of Ely, Nevada. At some point during the trip, they came upon an object landed directly in the center of the road. George stopped the car and attempted to walk up to the object, causing a surprising reaction from the UFO occupants.

CASE TWO: THE UFO HOUSE. One evening in December 2012, an anonymous couple from Sierra Vista, Arizona stepped outside their home to do some stargazing. Looking at a fenced-in field next to their home, they were amazed to see what appeared to be a small strange-looking structure with only a few windows. It was odd because it hadn't been there earlier in the day. How had it appeared? Puzzled, they didn't think much of it until morning arrived, and they saw something they couldn't understand.

CASE THREE:  LANDING IN LUKACHUKAI: One evening in mid-August 1982, three men were driving to the Lukachukai Rodeo in Arizona when they saw a start-like object swoop towards them from above. Later on during the drive, they saw that the object had apparently landed in a ravine alongside the road. They exited the car and observed the object. But as they drove to their location, they were soon to learn that they were not the only witnesses.

CASE FOUR:  UFO LANDING IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY. In mid-June of 1955, Ted Kittredge was drawn outside his home by the sound of his dogs barking. To his amazement, he saw that a gigantic gold-colored sphere had landed in his front yard. Even more incredible, standing next to it were three seven-foot-tall human-looking ETs who had a message they wanted to share.   Todd was even more amazed when he learned that numerous other people in the area reported the same type of encounter.

CASE FIVE: THE OLD WISE ONES. Growing up on a 3000-acre ranch about fifty miles west of Colorado Springs, Colorado, Michael (pseudonym) experienced a series of UFO encounters, culminating in a UFO encounter during which he met a group of seven-foot-tall beings. Michael described them as "very gentle and loving" and says that they give him an important message and warning for all humanity.

CASE SIX: UFO LANDING AT LAS CRUCES. In the summer of 1952, Hilda McAfee and her mother were traveling along Highway 10 from Las Cruces to their home in Deming, New Mexico. Suddenly they saw a blinding blue light ahead of them in the road. Slowing down, they saw a large object landed in the road, and next to it stood two strange-looking humanoids. It was an encounter that would leave them both shaken, not only mentally, but physically.

CASE SEVEN: UFO LANDING IN CONKLIN. On July 16, 1964, Mrs. Travis was in her home in Conklin, New York, when her two sons, Edmund (age nine) and Randy (age seven), and their three friends announced that they had seen a spaceman, and needed to bring him a jar of water. When questioned about this, the children said a silvery object had landed in the field, and a short humanoid approached them. Questioned separately by the adults, the children stuck to their story.

These seven cases are just a few of the many, many UFO landing cases on record. If you would like to learn more about these cases and many others, check out my books, "UFOs over Arizona," "UFOs over Colorado," "UFOs over Nevada," "UFOs over New Mexico," and "UFOs over New York."

Jesus walking on water in the Sea of Galilee is a very well-known miraculous event. And of course, there is the account of Buddha performing the same wondrous talent. Although these men both lived thousands of years ago, their incredible feats are still remembered today. But what many people don't realize is that there are dozens of cases from many different cultures throughout history in which people have walked on water. Some of these accounts were widely viewed by outside witnesses and are surprisingly well-verified.

For example, in the year 350, St. Ammon of Egypt was viewed by his disciple to float over a river.

In the 4th century, Saint Bessarion reportedly walked across the Nile, the Takazze River and the Barada River.

Another early case is Raymond of Pennafort, confessor to King James I of Aragon. Raymond was seen by hundreds of spectators to travel from the Island of Mayorca to Barcelona, a distance of 160 miles, using only his cloak as a flotation device. Many sailors observed this event, and Raymond's arrival on the shore was observed by a crowd of hundreds.

Many of the early cases involve various saints. In the 6th century, Maurus rescued Saint Placid from drowning in a lake in Subiaco, Italy. Maurus ran across the surface of the lake and retrieved Placid. Only upon returning to the shore did he realize that he had actually walked on water.

In 1430, Blessed Alvarez of Cordova, Italy joined the list of people who have walked on water when he was seen walking across a flooded river to reach his monastery. 

 In the early 1500s, Saint Peter of Alcantara was observed to walk across the Guadiana River in Spain. 

Aso in the 1500s, Saint Seraphino was seen walking across the Potenza River in Italy.

One of the most remarkable and widely viewed accounts of walking on water occurred in the 1700s to Saint Gerard of Majella, who was seen by a crowd of hundreds of people to walk on water in order to rescue a small boat that was sinking off the coast of Italy.

While many of the early cases involve saints, accounts come from all over the world from a wide variety of people of different cultures.

In the 1800s, "Dengnabine," a well-known Azande Medicine Man from Africa was observed to walk on water.

Another famous case from the 1800s is that of Mademoiselle Frederica Hauffe of France, also known as the Seer of Provorst. She displayed numerous psychic abilities, among them one instance of walking on water.

Two saints from Russia, Saint Basil (1800s) and Saint Zachary (1900s) were both seen by witnesses to walk on water.

An amusing and modern case occurred on July 18, 1837 to an eight-year-old Russian boy named Nikolai Yurlov. On that evening, Nikolai was woken up by a ghostly apparition. He became so frightened that he fled his home in terror and actually ran across the surface of the Sviyaga River. Servants who were chasing the boy were shocked to find Nikolai on the other side of the river, completely dry.

In 1894, explorer and researcher Baird T. Spaulding traveled with a group of men to study the miracles of Enlightened Masters from the Far East. While visiting India, they met a group of Yogis who took them on a journey to the foothills of the Himalayas. Spaulding and his companions observed a group of a dozen yogis traverse a large river by walking on the surface of the water. The yogis explained that with the proper training, anyone could learn to attain this ability.

One of the most unusual cases of this kind comes from Angelo Faticoni of Jacksonville, Florida. Also called "The Human Cork" and "The Man They Could Not Drown." Faticoni repeatedly demonstrated his ability to stay afloat on the surface of the water for hours at a time in virtually any position. He could stay on the surface lying on his side, his back or curled up in a ball. He could even sleep on the water. He was able to swim long distances. He subjected himself to numerous experiments including allowing himself to be tied down with weights or sewn into a sac. Still he remained on the surface of the water. Scientists from Harvard University studied his case and were unable to explain Faticoni's amazing ability.

These are just a few of the many cases of people who have displayed this unusual ability to walk on water. French researcher Olivier Leroy lists many other saints with this ability. Can humans walk on water? The answer is apparently yes!

While UFO sightings are undeniably interesting, even more fascinating are accounts of actual contact. Missing time, face-to-face contact with ETs, onboard encounters -- these kinds of cases provide deep insights into what it's like to have an extraterrestrial experience. 

This video presents five extraordinary cases of UFO contact. Each case is different and shows just how truly strange, bizarre and enlightening it can be to have a close-up encounter with beings from other worlds.

<h4>CASE ONE: I DID NOT EXIST FOR A DAY</h4>
In the summer of 1973, a wall street executive flew by 747 from Hawaii to his home in New York City. During the flight, he was shocked to see a metallic saucer outside the window, pacing the jet. At first, he thought it was just a simple sighting. It wasn't until he got home and received a huge shock that he realized his encounter was far more than just a sighting.

<h4>CASE TWO: THE ABDUCTION OF TOM MURILLO</h4>
One evening in 1976, New Mexico resident Tom Murillo took a drive to cool off after a family quarrel. Parking alongside a remote country road, he was approached by a strange tall figure. Moments later, he found himself being levitated inside a tube of light into a UFO craft. Inside, he was undressed, placed on a table and examined by gray ETs. But it's what they did next that left him stunned. And after being placed back in his car, Tom realized that he had just undergone the most profound and unusual experience of his life.

<h4>CASE THREE: MISSING TIME IN MOUNDHOUSE</h4>
One night in April of 1996, Paul (pseudonym), was driving to his home in Dayton, Nevada. Just after passing through the small desert town of Moundhouse, he saw a brilliant light ahead of him. Very quickly the light grew in size and landed alongside the highway, revealing itself to be an enormous saucer-shaped craft. Two tiers of windows lined the circumference. Looking through the windows, Paul saw more than a dozen strange figures looking down at him. Some were grays, but some were much stranger beings. And then they began to communicate with him, initiating an encounter that would alter the path of his life forever.

<h4>CASE FOUR: CONTACT IN TONOPAH</h4>
On the evening of July 21, 2009, four friends (James, Henry, Heather and Jamie) decided to go UFO hunting in the deserts outside of Tonopah, Arizona. They had heard of recent sightings in the area and were hoping to have one themselves. Little did they realize that they were about to have a face-to-face encounter with extraterrestrials. Without warning, a gigantic triangular-shaped craft hovered overhead and then landed in front of them. A panel opened, and out stepped two strange humanoids, a short gray alien and an eight-foot-tall being. The two ETs began to communicate telepathically with the witnesses, giving them a dire warning to share with all humanity. James was able to videotape the entire encounter. After the craft departed however, the military showed up and surrounded their vehicle. Their lives, they knew, would never be the same.

<h4>CASE FIVE: IS GRANDPA AN ALIEN?</h4>
In 1955, five-year-old Marty Minetto was spending time with his grandparents in their 
home outside of Ault, Colorado. On April 9, Marty's grandfather approached him and 
asked him if he'd like to go for a walk and have a great adventure. Marty agreed. The 
next morning, Marty and his grandfather left the farmhouse and walked out into the 
remote fields by their home. To Marty's amazement, a large glowing egg-shaped craft 
dropped from the sky and landed in front of them. Moments later, a human-looking man 
stepped out and invited them both onboard. Marty's grandfather explained that it was 
time for Marty to learn about who his grandfather really was. So began an incredible 
onboard encounter during which Marty was given a tour of the craft and learned many 
secrets about the people inside it. It was the first of several other encounters that 
finally answered some of the strange mysteries surrounding his unusual grandfather.

These five true cases of UFO contact are just a few of the many accounts that are 
occurring all across our planet. We are not alone in this universe. We have never 
been alone.

According to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC,) California has more UFO 
sightings than any other state in the United States. So it should come as no surprise 
that there are many cases involving UFO photographs. In fact, there are hundreds of 
incidents in which witnesses have been able to capture images of unidentified flying 
objects.

This video presents more than fifty cases of some of the best UFO photographs taken in the state of California. Many of these are multiple-witness cases with photographs that have been authenticated by UFO researchers and photographic experts. Some are well-known, while others have received almost no publicity. The majority of these photographs show solid metallic objects hovering in the sky. In some of these cases, it appears that the UFOs want to be seen, and are posing for the witnesses.

It has often been said that a picture is worth a thousand words. When it comes to UFOs, this is especially true. These amazing photographs provide hard evidence for the reality of the extraterrestrial presence on our planet. We are not alone! And these photographs prove it!

With so many cases, the state of California has had a profound effect on our understanding and knowledge of the UFO phenomenon.
